Good job, your slides were well laid out and your delivery was great. In reviewing the case study, I found it interesting that the team chose to rework the application in the \"older\" technologies given the availability of new techniques in modularization - SOA and web services (Java\/.Net) - would you characterize such in-place rework as really an exercise in maintenance vs a necesary step to the applications evolution? Simply put, if the team understood the workings of the application to the degree they did, why was a port to a new technology with SOA built in not undertaken?

I believe the decision is made at the senior management level in regard to try keeping the existing codes but modularized them. I will probably not classifying this rework at maintenance but more like an upgrade. Usually maintenance are considered as activities that are routine and periodical and this is definitely not the case. The authors did not really state the reasons why not moving to the newer development platform like SOA. Here are some of possible reasons based on my experience: (1) Money. Since most the codes can be reused, the initial development cost might be lower. This cost includes both hardware and labour. (2) Shorter timeline. (3) Employees skillset. A typical banking organization can have hundreds or even thousands of developers. Many of them have been with the company for many years. Converting everyone to a new platform is not an easy task and the training cost is significant. (4) Senior management do not see the value. This kind of backend development makes total sense to us but it is a foreign language to business executives. In today's economy, it is tough to sell any project that is neither increasing the revenue nor reducing the cost in a short run. Especially for the bank in this article, all the issues that have been identified seem to be technical related.  (5) Banking organizatons tend be conservative. They \"hate\" changes!!! I know an international bank that they are still using COBOL extensively today. I am sure some of you still rememeber that...so sad. I hope I answser your questions.

Through this pre-defined relationship, we can promote best practice and standards in terms of module relationship. Also developers only need to know the hierarchical location of his\/her module, inputs and outputs and do not need to worry about the implementation detail of other modules. This is expecially important for the concept of information hiding. This consistency in terms of design makes support and future changes a lot easier.  As you can see, security is not really the focus of this strategy. However, it might create a clearer relationship between modules which makes security implementation simpler. I hope I answer your question.

Its focus on the modularization metrics and defined API communication protocols does help establishing a solid framework for future modularization projects. Many of the previous researches related to this topic focus only on the ROI of modularization rather than level of modularization. By following author's metrics, we can develop a direct relationship between ROI and level of modularization. Through this relationship, the practitioners can better estimate the net benefit of a modularization project. They can better understand why a modularization project fails and succeed. We can then develop a set of standards and best practices that are supported by quantitative numbers rather than indirect data or subjective observations.

It allows less technical people, like me, to understand the implications of the project before applying the technical\/programming framework to it. Thank you for your overview of the waterfall model - I was not aware of it. Your diagram helped. Real Word <===> Requirements <===> Software Design <===> Code. I wasn't clear on whether SRS addresses only the requirements part of the Waterfall model or whether it applied to each stage? If it is applied to each stage, can you give me a brief update on how? I've tried to use a version of SRS in the past. One struggle I've faced is that you can't get every use case - maybe most, but usually not all. I find that realizing the 'missed' use case later on then forces you back to the beginning which can take up a lot of time. So, I guess one would argue that SRS is too detailed and can actually take more time than save time. What are you thoughts on this?

Technically SRS should be applied to each phase (something to crosscheck) but as I understood it the authors didn't do that because of the complexity it would have caused. That is why I think the authors should have used other models to really validate their research such as the spiral model which has clear phases and easily repeatable. As you might know in project management as the project goes through its lifecycle it goes through the  four phases (initiating, executing, monitoring and closing). So for example when a risk management plan was initiated it would go through the four phases.  As a practicing project manager, I think there should be as much detail in the requirements and sign off by all stakeholders on the project scope. So in the review phase by all stakeholders you can go back to the beginning and rework anything that needs to be modified. Another thing to remember is that often times not all stakeholders are identified. Finallyh, anything that is not clear should be the responsibility of the project manager to validate.  I apologize if i veered off topic here, but I hope it answered your question if not I will try again Regards Manveer","courseId":143,"phaseId":4,"postId":42286,"postCreationTime":1222787531,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":42214,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d30600e"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":15073,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Manveer Pabla - Requirements Analysis for Engineering Computation: A Systematic Approach for Improving Reliability","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Manveer Pabla - Requirements Analysis for Engineering Computation: A Systematic Approach for Improving Reliability"},{"postUserId":4873,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Manveer, Interesting presentation. I was comfortable with the pace at which the material was being presented.

This is a very tough question so I would like to answer this in mutiple ways First, I know most of the times designers \/developers are told what has to be used which in my opinion stifles creativity.  Second in order to get the algorithm to conform to set standards I think it would require more time or a different product (in terms of development) for the project which in most cases is something the developer \/designer doesn't have the luxury of doing or exploring. The way I think devlopers can get close is having them available during the creation of the requirements document (afterall they are stakeholders too). Speaking from a project management aspect often times when a requirements documentation is done many SME's feedback is not solicited which I believe is the reason for high failures or not being able to engineer an application where a given algorithm is conformed to set standards to make the product that was requested.

Many users of waterfall now recognize that requirements (etc.) are missed or change and that it doesn't mean the project will necessarily fail to revisit an earlier stage although the emphasis is to get it right the first time. Therefore they will revisit earlier stages. This \"modified waterfall\" has elements of spiral in it when iteration occurs.

Here are my responses. First of all, sorry for the black screens due to I didn't record my presentation in one take. For your first question, As for the paper itself you indicated that related research was largely focused on the drop and reconnect issue. Does STEAM handle that to the point where it is no longer an issue? As the author mentioned in the section of related works, some of the research concentrated on handling of disconnection problem by awaring an entity moves from one access point to another. However, STEAM accommodates a set of collaborative entities together at a location and supports communication between these entities without relying on the infrastructure networks. In my opinion, yes, it is no longer an issue due to every research has their own approach on this issue. I think it's a wondering point that the authors clarified the issue in the beginning but didn't focus on in the later sections. For your second question, Also with regards to the proximity management and filtering is that handled by the location service? If so how does it handle multiple information - more than one event firing? I presume that would be the case in the ambulance scenario or the circular scope concept. I think I didn't explain this part very well in the presentation. In the authors' description, they apply Location-based event filtering to support three classes of event filters: subject filters, content filters, and proximity filters. Proximity filters define the geographical scope within which certain events are relevant and correspond to the proximities that producers may announce. In addition, the Location Service (LS) component of STEAM is to supply GPS information. The proximity management and filtering should be handled by Proximity Discovery Service (PDS). The proximity can be defined depend on its speed and prevailing road conditions, by its local producer. You may see the figures and discovery mechanism in the slide 14. STEAM middleware may support different consumers and producers on each mobile device, thereby allowing individual devices to both produce and consume events. The event type and proximity information announced by producers are applied by the PDS to establish communication between mobile entities.

Let me try to explain the paper's concepts with your  example. The authors applied location-based event filter into their event-based middleware design, thus, an entity with producer (i.e. a traffic light) may propagate a vaild event (i.e. road speed change, or its light status) within a certain geographical area (proximity). Correspondingly, an entity with consumer (i.e. a moving car) may subscribe to intestered events and will be interacted while it is closer to the producer. Therefore, the authors proposed that their approach limits forwarding of event messages and reduces the usage of communication and computation resources. There are some other filters and techniques were applied in their approach to fit different scenarios (i.e. stationary or mobile). We could talk more if you are interesting.

I try to answer your questions precisely, we could discuss more if there is any unclear part in my responses. 1. This is a good point to me. When I read this paper, I paid more attentions on the software design. But they did proposed the conceptual model of STEAM in their earlier research. Some other research on middleware software design in the references also proposed different conceptual models to better describe the functions of component and data flow. 2. The direct communication means the producer need to build a round of communication to the subscriber before deliverying the matched events. It also means the communication is assigned and doesn't go through the fixed networks such as the access points. 3. In my opinion,  these scenarios are used to point out how to propagate the services with location-dependent context under the static or moving circumstances of the entities. I assume that you are interesting in the effect of signal under the different the climate condition. However, it might affect more to the fixed networks than ad hoc networks. These scnarios are generally applied in the development of location-based or context-aware mobile application, thus, I think all of them need to be considered as the software requirements for the future devleopment. 4. As the examples I used in the slides, the two techniques are applied in different cases (i.e. independent events for stationary entity and depentent events for mobile entity), but they both are necerry to build a conprehansive software architecture. 5. The research didn't focus on specific application. In my understanding, they analyze the current middleware softwares for mobile application and requirements for mobile computing environment, and then design their middleware architecture. These middlewares are essential techniques due to the reducing of computing efforts and resources are important issues for the distributed computing environment.

As a programmer who started early (wrote my first program in 1967, and professionally, in 1975), I started out writing almost everything from scratch. An 'Operating System', of sorts. was usually produced along with the application, as part of the same development effort. Sometimes code already tested could be used 'off the shelf', from one development to the next. This was, in fact, desirable. The Apollo mission code was written in the 60's. I have NEVER been an advocate of depending on 3rd party Operating Systems, or software libraries. Microsoft Windows, in particular, in its various incarnations, has never proven to be reliable for real-time applications. Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, and other Unix derivatives, and other OSs for real-time embedded, especially 'mission critical' applications, like aerospace, military, communications, etc., often include access to the source code, and 'bugs' have a good chance of being properly investigated and fixed. There has been a trend, in the last twenty years, to plug third party libraries of code into systems. One might suggest that developers, these days, are more like 'librarians' or 'copy editors than 'programmers'. 'Out-sourcing' is making things worse, as you stated. Third party library usage and unreliable operating systems make a good case for supporting efforts like the USL project. I, for one would, like to see 'commercial' development brought to a level of maturity that includes rigorous design, test, and validation. Will this happen in my lifetime?

You mentioned one of the more serious problems. Too many assumptions are made about the third party being reliable and knowledgeable. There is the issue of third party library\/API certification and validation. There is also the issue, that I mentioned earlier, of programmers (library clerks \/ copy editors) (especially in the 'commercial' domain) being too ready to grab third party code, to save time or money. If one develops a system that includes third party code from multiple suppliers, and something 'does not work'; Well, who's problem is it? (That's rhetorical). Are third party suppliers expected to debug 'end-user' systems, under development? (Also rhetorical). Historically, mission critical engineering system development projects INSISTED that source code be supplied with operating systems or third party code to be included in a system. That is not the case in the commercial domain and, unfortunately, I have seen problems in the engineering domain as a result of accepting third party code that has not been certified for a particular use or application. Would you be comfortable flying over the ocean in a plane who's critical control systems depended on Microsoft code? But that isn't going to happen, because Microsoft code is NOT certified for avionics use. (Though uncertified code is appearing, to the chagrin of, the simulator industry). My point, I think, is that the commercial development domain, and lately, unfortunately, the engineering domain, there has been a worrying tendency to accept unvalidated code to save time and money. This is causing problems. The lessons learned from exercises like the Apollo flight software development have not been retained. USL, whether I endorse that particular initiative or not, is an attempt to bring some integrity back into the process of system design. I suppose it is easier, and cheaper, to replace a $20 toaster with a newer $15 toaster with fancier buttons, every two or three years, than pay for a $200 toaster that works for a lifetime.

On the topic: How would you compare and contrast USL with UML? From what I can tell USL is geared towards modeling real-time embedded software for hardware control, where UML does not seem to have any constraint. With respect to the author's claims of eliminating interface errors by design, I believe this is supported by UML as well, and there are automated tools that can detect interface errors at build time for most languages today. Also the approach to error handling \"kill and restart\" may be the way to go when we are talking about embedded software where the time to restart is quick (given that the hardware is function specific), but in an n-tier environment in say an e-commerce system, this approach could be disastrous (can you imagine having to go back and select all your shoppoing cart items if your credit card was declined?)

USL could be considered one of the contributing efforts that led to the introduction of UML. UML, though, in my opinion, is too far removed, or too abstract, from the application or system it is supposed to represent. USL presents a more rigorous design approach. UML tries to be totally platform or IDE independent. My impression is that UML is rather superficial. Using UML in order to appear to be 'up to date' with 'modern' methodologies is not a good way to design a system. I once had a colleague who had created large 'C' header files to contain macros that enabled him to 'code' in an abstract style. The code was unreadable and un-maintainable. One must be careful to choose a design approach that includes the requirements analysis and the development environment. A danger with adopting any of the modelling methodologies is to find oneself too far removed from the application. Trying to be too far abstracted from the intended implementation can leave you with an inefficient system. A jack of all platforms and a master of none. I believe these modelling methodologies can, indeed, be used as effective design tools; but, with due care and attention. Returning to the 'commercial' versus 'real-time, embedded' comparison, a widget intended for global web use might not suffer much from being overly abstracted. A control algorithm for a mission-critical safety system on a resource-starved remote-controlled space-ship probably would.","courseId":177,"phaseId":3,"postId":53125,"postCreationTime":1254056629,"courseCategoryId":16,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/09 Archived","postParentId":53083,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d30689f"},"forumId":1051,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":18543,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F09","postTitle":"Re: Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo,","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/09 Archives","topicName":"Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo,"},{"postUserId":5280,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Steven, A question about the \"kill and restart\" mechanism for dealing with errors.

In a real-time, mission-critical system, it is close to imperative that a system be able to recover from absolutely ANY error condition. As the various application layers are started up, and the system passes through several 'init' layers, or sequences of execution, 'snapshots' of system status can be taken (including memory allocation maps and stack status). In the event of an apparently 'FATAL' error condition, with no immediately known cause, a system can report, and record, information pertaining to the error condition, for post-mortem analysis, then 'restore' itself to a known execution snapshot state and resume execution. In a prioritized, asynchronous system, an event requiring priority service from the processor can get that priority service, even if some erroneous condition is attempting to 'hog' the CPU's attention (e.g. as happens often in Windows environments). A central, or 'global', error handling scheme is a necessity. Java even tries to do that, to a degree, though it only goes half way. One doesn't have to kill and restart an entire system. 'Known' execution recovery points can be established, and resumption from otherwise fatal operating conditions can be effected. There are limitations on what can be recovered, of course, depending on the nature and extent of the 'damage', but, in a real-time system, the 'current' state is more important than the 'last known' state. This might be an issue for database servers, like Oracle, for example. These systems, too , have limitations on what can be recovered, and they also have checkpoints (and transaction logs) for recovery to 'known' states for error recovery. USL tries to prevent catastrophic error conditions during the design stages, by ensuring that all possible interactions between SOOs are accounted for, in the design. I am not convinced that the USL schema is perfect, but it is, I think going in the right direction.","courseId":177,"phaseId":3,"postId":53100,"postCreationTime":1254016961,"courseCategoryId":16,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/09 Archived","postParentId":53091,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d3068c4"},"forumId":1051,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":18543,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F09","postTitle":"Re: Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo,","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/09 Archives","topicName":"Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo,"},{"postUserId":1323,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Note for Sabine: In responding to comments and questions, are we meant to defend the author's position or case, or, rather, participate in discussion on the topic?","courseId":177,"phaseId":0,"postId":53101,"postCreationTime":1254017157,"courseCategoryId":16,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/09 Archived","postParentId":53100,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d3007cc"},"forumId":1051,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":18543,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F09","postTitle":"Re: Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo,","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/09 Archives","topicName":"Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo,"},{"postUserId":1388,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hello Steven, The USL is a new topic to me.

Oh yes, most definitely open systems and standards are crucial for middleware and the next generation of applications. As for what are some of the \"big players\" doing in this area - here is a few of their initiatives with my commentary: IBM INITIATIVE - \"Autonomic Systems\" I mentioned this one in a previous post. IBM is working on \"Autonomic Computing\" which gets its inspiration from the human body's autonomic nervous system. IBM refers to their adaptive technology as self-CHOP: self-configure, self-heal, self-optimize and self-protect. A good place to start would be here: http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/autonomic\/library\/ac-edge4\/ As for the middleware component, there was an article in which the Director of IBM Research gave an interview which gives insight to how IBM sees middleware and adaptive systems: http:\/\/www.infoworld.com\/articles\/hn\/xml\/01\/03\/13\/010313hnhorn.html I'm not going to go into great details about the above article since, of course, you can read it for yourself but a couple of interesting quotes from it: \"At the heart of this design is intelligent middleware that functions autonomically\". The property of the middleware as being \"intelligent\" is most revealing; it echos the motivation of the paper I presented. \"This must be an entirely heterogeneous environment, [one that is] platform agnostic, and one [that is] dependent on open standards. And middleware must support all modes of access to it, be they cell phones, kiosks, Web-connected appliances, embedded devices, or even PCs,\" So yes, here is the ubiquitous (everyware) and mobile argument (anyware) and he also brings forth the issue of open standards that are going to be essential. \"Middleware is doing things like transcoding, where you can change the data so it takes on the characteristics for whatever the end-user device is.\" This relates to the dynamic swapping\/inserting of middleware components as needed in order for the device to participate with its peers; this ability to communicate freely and seemlessly is going to require open (common) standards. \"As a company we have been pushing these new [software] standards such as UDDI [Universal Description Discovery and Integration] ... We believe they are critical ... If you don't have standards [then] you don't know how to communicate between one marketplace and another or even between one business and another.\" Self-explanatory quote here; again the emphasis on open standards. I found it coincidental that UDDI was mentioned as was in the presentation. IBM is also offering some of this technology publically free-for-use. You can read more at: http:\/\/www.internetnews.com\/ent-news\/article.php\/2175911 MICROSOFT - Dynamic Systems Initiative (DSI) Not to be left out of the party; Microsoft has their own similiar technology with \"Dynamic Systems Initiative\": self-administering, self-tuning, and self-healing. Microsoft has a white paper on this located at: http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/business\/dsi\/dsiwp.mspx One particular relevant quote from the paper: \"The System Definition Model (SDM) provides a common description language ... And while SML [Service Modeling Language] started out as a Microsoft technology, the System Definition Model (SDM), to demonstrate our commitment to open standards and interoperability, we have since handed over responsibility for SML to an industry leading open standards group.\" Once again it appears that industry has realized the need for open standards\/systems.

As for the 'audio effect' if it seemed planned, well it wasn't :) - Just technical difficulties with the microphone's gain but I got through. Great question you asked and yes this is one of the concerns that is commonly raised with these adaptive systems. The idea of autonomous software agents that can make decisions based on their perceived situation may be disconcerting to some. The first point is that adaptive systems are not necessarily the best choice for all situations; there are those circumstances where you do not want your software to problem solve. However, in situations where the environment is unkown and all variables can not be predicted; adaptive systems may be the only solution. With adaptive systems, the thought that they would perform 'unpredictably' is not really an issue. Let me explain by example. Suppose you have an intelligent\/adaptive system whose purpose is to monitor the health of say a nuclear power plant. The system would be constrained by the following set of rules (I'm making these rules up as I really don't have a knowledge of what a power plant rules would be): 1. Core temperature must not exceed 300 degrees Celcius 2. The reactor pressure must be between 15 and 16 MPa So the adaptive system's goal is to maintain the acceptable 'safe' environment state. If the state of the environment begins to deviate from normal thresholds (ie: temperature rises above 300); the system's goal would be to attempt to correct the problem by using some form of artificial intelligence (fuzzy logic, neural networks, knowledge based deductive reasoning, etc) to come up with a plan to bring the system back into an acceptable state. The combination of plans it can choose from is often constrained as well (I'm sure one of the plans it would have available to it would be 'commence emergency shutdown'). This ability is extremely useful in situations where it would be impossible to predict every combination of IF-THEN-ELSE statements. Instead, you give the system a set of acceptable environment states and a set of possible actions it could perform based on a set of preconditions of the environment. So the adaptive system really isn't in a situation where it can react unpredictably but more so in a situation where it can react to the unpredictable. IBM is touting a technology it developed called Autonomic Computing based on the idea of the autonomic nervous system in which it is capable of self-healing, self-protecting, and self-optimizing. Again, it is given a set of 'safe' states for the system and will attempt to correct problems by bringing the system back to the safe state. The system is considered to have failed if it gets into a state that is not within predefined norms and a solution can not be found.","courseId":119,"phaseId":4,"postId":35027,"postCreationTime":1201213054,"courseCategoryId":8,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/08 Archive","postParentId":34995,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d304dee"},"forumId":720,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":12723,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W08","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 Presentation: A Perspective on the Future of Middleware-based Software Engineering","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/08 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 Presentation: A Perspective on the Future of Middleware-based Software Engineering"},{"postUserId":1352,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi John, Thanks for the comprehensive reply. It helped me to grasp gist of adabptive system. Example also help to boost understanding.

I got the point although I don't agree with everything the authors suggest. For example how can SOA help devices to adapt at the protocol layer(IPX\/SPX vs TCP\/IP) when the protocol layer is used to communicate with the network. Maybe you can help me understand how this is possible. I agree with another comment that I have seen that it is very tricky to adpat to the context and make asumptions. However that being said, when I get into my new Sebring it instantly recognizes my blue tooth cell phone and assumes that I want to use that to place a call when I hit the button on the dash. I have given it a rule to use my wifes phone when we are both in the car together.

However, I think the way we resolve this is as follows. When device A wishes to communicate with device B, device A does not ask the device \"Hey, what protocol do you speak?\" Since, obviously, if it got an answer back then device A already knew what protocol to use. Instead device A can DISCOVER the protocol of device B. Here is an example to demonstrate: At my work I happen to have a legacy Novell File Server that has recently been decommissioned (but still on the network). My laptop uses TCP\/IP. If I ask the laptop to probe the network for Novell Servers (using the slist command) I get the following error message: root@MScIS:~# slist slist: Server not found (0x8847) in ncp_open That's because I need to be able to speak IPX\/SPX. I know there is a Novell-like device on the network but I can't communicate with it because of different communication protocols. How do I know there is such a device? Well for one, I installed it, but even if I didn't, I could detect there was some device on the network by looking at the ethernet frames (data link layer) that is coming into my laptop. Also by examing the ethernet frames itself I could make a good guess of what the protocol might be (if you do tcpdump or whatever packet analyzer it can usually determine the packet type). So my dilemma is I don't have the right communication layer - no problem. With most UNIX like systems I can dynamically swap-in a kernel module to give me that compatibility like this: root@MScIS: insmod ipx.ko root@MScIS: ipx_configure --auto_interface=on --auto_primary=on root@MScIS: slist Known NetWare File Servers ___Network___Node Address -------------------------------------------------------------------------- SD73___________________________41050040_000000000001 The \"insmod ipx.ko\" dynamically inserts the IPX\/SPX communication protocol. The ipx_configure sets-up my network card to be a novell node (I could of skipped the insmod and the ipx_configure would have automatically inserted that kernel module anyway). The slist command probes for Novell Servers as before but this time it works. When I'm finished with this novell server, I can just as easily remove(unload) the ipx kernel module. So it's very doable to have middleware swap-in or swap-out communication protocols. Where the SOA part might come in handy is to allow the application to have a conversation with its own middleware layers (not someone elses) like this: Application (on device A) talking to its own Middleware(also on device A): \"There appears to be a peer network device\" Middleware of A to Application on A: \"Yes there is, it appears to use SPX\/IPX\" Application A to Middleware A: \"Can you provide the protocol? (service)\" Middleware A to Application A: \"Yes I can\" (middleware loads the ipx kernel module and configures the interface) Application A to Application B: \"Hello, my name is ...\" (communication with application B now can commence. Through SOA and other technologies, application A can query for services available on Application B). The above example also illustrates the advantage of not having 100% transparency even at the communication layer. If I didn't know I had the ipx kernel module as an option I could have never been able to communicate with the novell server.

The one question I had through the entire presentation is why the paper was called the \"Golden Age ...\", but you answered that at the end. There were a couple of things I wished I knew more about. It could be the case that they weren't in the paper, and I don't necessarily expect you to have information on them or for you to follow up on them. In any case, here they are: In the timeline of phases things like dependability, maintainability, information hiding, etc. I usually think of those things in the context of OOP or a specific programming language. I've never really thought about that from the higher level of Software Architecture. It'd be interesting to review all those terms in that context. You mentioned various architectures in passing on various slides, but I never got a sense of the full scope of available architectures, where they're best applied, what their strengths\/weeknesses are, and how those artitectures developed along the timeline. That would be a whole course right there, I'm sure. At one point you mentioned \"architecture views\" and I'm not clear on what those are.

We have thousands of applications developed in COBOL, which has a front presentation layer built in Java, and all the data flowing through the applications must be treated as confidential and on a need to know only basis (this is one of my biggest headaches because my programs needs files(data) from other applications which doesn\u2019t belong to my team, and because of the confidential issues, I cannot go in and see if the data is corrupt or changed or if someone wants to just toy with me \u2013 so I do a lot of development in the dark  ), so the applications must be designed in a way that certain parts can be hidden in an effective manner (COBOL is nothing close to having OOP). Some of it is accomplished by creating profiles for certain files and others are done by Job Control Language (JCL). Dependability and Maintainability are two of the largest concerns within organization, since it\u2019s a Federal Information system which is used on a daily basis throughout the nation, if something goes wrong, it will go up to the minister level.

Very interesting topic, almost like a historical research paper. You might want to check this link out from Jeff Atwood's 'CODING HORROR' blog - http:\/\/www.codinghorror.com\/blog\/archives\/000686.html, he also talks about the Redwine-Riddle Model. I liked your criticism of the author not giving an opinion of what software architecture as a discipline is, and blown away that there were that many definitions. True, I think the moment Bill Gates became 'Software Architect', there was a general moan across the software engineering world. Your comment in the forum about \"Web 2.0 is definitely going to be a key player in the future of software architecture\" is interesting, though i'm not convinced AJAX will allow the kind of semantic web the W3C is envisioning with RDF and OWL, maybe Web 3.0? I wonder, though, if you were concerned about the authors idea regarding a Golden Age. Only because it sounds so definitive. Isn't this what Rational tries to do with UML and OOP's? Take the gravity a particular language might have over an application (i.e. COBOL's pronounced demise, then resturection) and allow any current and future language to be only a tool to create based on an overarching plan, nee architecture? Is this maybe what they are trying to suggest with the idea of when software architecture goes from being 'novel to indespensible'? Thank you.

If the project is small enough, there might not be a need for an engineer or even the engineer is able to play both roles and vice-versa. Even with us, we have a section with network engineers, who build the various network structure, but they still report(not in a managerial structure, but more like a hierarchical consult) to the Systems\/Technology Architects. I don't foresee the role of architects diminishing at all, I could see the role evolving, but not diminishing.

Although it was not the focus of this research, I am curious to know what is the overhead added by Hibernate in the relational database. The performance comparison is between a ODMS (DB4O) and RDBMS + ORM tool (Postgres + Hibernate), but what are the fractions of the RDMS and the ORM tool? For example, if the creation time result is 200 seconds for Hibernate\/Postgres, how many seconds Hibernate spent for mapping, and how many seconds the database spent to add the records? As you mentioned, inherited classes were mapped to tables in the relational database. Did the authors make any comparison related to views? A relational database could have a view which joins multiple tables, and this view could be mapped to a single class in Hibernate. I am just wondering if in this case, Hibernate would offer a better performance. Thanks for the presentation.

They survey over a dozen current component models. In the paper, I have not found any mention of open source components. Though, the authors do not mention any open source components, I can safely argue that the component models, whose component semantics is architectural units or syntax is architectural description language, allow any type of programing language of your choice during deployment. The examples are UML 2.0, SOFA, PECOS, Koala and Acme-Like ADLs - as these component model allow composition during the design phase. Also, The component models such as Fractal and Web Services are not constrained to any one particular programming language, unlike COM and EJB. Therefore, I believe these component models allow open source components. If you would like to know more about open component model, please read the book chapter: An Open Component Model and Its Support in Java by Eric Bruneton, Thierry Coupaye, Matthieu Leclercq, Vivien Quema, and Jean-Bernard Stefani from the book : Componet Based Software Engineering. with regards, Bhasker","courseId":143,"phaseId":3,"postId":42288,"postCreationTime":1222788185,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":42266,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d30601d"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":15074,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Bhasker Garudadri - Software Component Models","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Bhasker Garudadri - Software Component Models"},{"postUserId":1326,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Thanks Bhasker, for your reply.

With regard to your question, well, I have really leaned a valuable lessons on how build components in an ideal manner. In my programming profession, I\u2019m a great proponent of modularity and reusability. In fact, while developing software, I would always consider two aspects, 1) how to build the software on time, that meets the need of the user and 2) how to maximize the usage existing components that we were developed already in the organization. A pre-existing component, means, it is already well tested, therefore the software system using such reusable components is less defective than the one written from scratch. Also it is quicker to build. However, building a truly reusable component is not an easy affair, we need to anticipate future requirements as well, which is difficult . Moreover, the cost and time for developing such reusable components can prohibitively high.

Part 1 when we talk of the Component based models, is there any desirable platform it is to be designed in? All component models are not same. In current component models, a component can be either a object or a class or an architectural unit. In component models, if a component is an object, it is defined using interface definition language (IDL) and implemented in a programming language. For example, Microsoft's COM component uses Microsoft IDL for its definition while implementation language being either VB, Microsoft C++ or C#. On other hand, in component models where component is a class, the definition language coincides with implementation language. For example, in both JavaBeans and EJB, the definition language and implementation language of a component is Java. In the component models where a component is architectural units, the definition language is an ADL (Architecture Description Language) or an ADL-Like language, and implementation language is some other different programming language. In PECOS, the definition language is CoCo and the implementation language is C++ or Java. Part 2 A reusable component should in principle be usable on any platform? An ideal component must be reusable in a given component model. However, a component in one component model can NOT be used in another component model. For a example, a EJB component can not be used directly in .NET and vice versa.

I believe that authors should have used classification criteria a bit differently. rather than allowing each team to identify their own system, I feel it would be more beneficial to have a group (20-30 people) of software developers and architects analyzing these systems and then providing their opinions on architecture, effort needed to introduce changes and syntax in general. The requirement is that none of the members of such group had ever touched the projects they are analyzing. This would eliminate bias of team members towards their project (some may have spent on it only a few month whereas others may have spent years on a particular project). This way the results of this study could have bigger weight when used as reference in other studies as you have a large group of people analyzing large number of projects.

The other question, is that did the paper mention what type of applications (in terms of size and functionality) that had no architecture? Do we truely need pattern conformity in smaller projects? Does following Agile methodology affect pattern conformity or there is no relation what so ever between the project management methodologies used with Style Selection and conformity to architectural style?

There, prototypes of classes and functions are stored. Such document can be supplemented with UML diagrams. From my personal experience and previous class on project management that I took, I believe that documents such as development-related emails, minutes from development meetings should be included in such project as well. I believe this would help to understand logic and rationale about particular architectural decisions. Authors advise using layered architecture and subsystems architecture if it seems that software projects will be more than 500,000 lines. One of the obvious reasons is that there will be teams of people working on this project and it is easier to assign logical \"areas\" within project that are conveniently divided into layers or subsystems. I haven't found in the paper mentioning \"type\" of the appilcation. In the beggining author states that all the projects that were used differed by number of lines of code (LOC) and that it was part of this study to classify such projects according to their architecture. No other categorization was mentioned. Pattern conformity should be followed whenever possible as it will reduce not only maintenance costs in the long-run but also training costs of developers that maintaining and changing it.

The results of the layered architecture did not fair so well in terms of software erosion (3 were ok but 5 had erosion). Yet the author recommends this architecture for \u201Cstep 2\u201D of her roadmap. Does the paper provide any details to explain this? The author indicates that the layered model is better for larger projects but the description seems to be vague.

The \"cycles\" are referred to relationships in architectural structures. Basically author was comparing architectures on a subject how close in their structure they are to \"directed acyclic graph\" (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Directed_acyclic_graph). If architecture can be mapped onto directed acyclic graph then all relationships between entities are clearly represented and you can design higher-end modules of your software project. I mention in presentation that layered architectures are less strict when it comes to class relationships and reference-based architectures are more strict. This explains why layered architectures have \"more messy\" class structure but \"less messy\" layer structure and vice versa. One architecture has better detail management but when you have to take a look at a bigger picture, and divide work, it's harder to deal with layers and subsystems. Other one has great scope\\scalability management but detail suffers. It's not unusual that Layered architectures had more software erosion if you remember criteria how software erosion is defined :1. Can developers tell what architecture is it? Can developers change software project or would rather write anew from scratch? What's the naming convention for classes. Layered architecture per author's recommendation supposed to be used in larger projects--and it is much tougher physically to process hundreds of thousands lines of code and identify architecture than with thousand lines of code. Also larger systems are harder to modify and this infers from condition 1 (if you can't tell what something is, how can you change it accurately?). Lastly naming convention would be worse in layered systems because of the looseness on class definitions. In roadmap authors recommends planning and implementing layers. This is perfectly normal practice if project is expected to grow with time, to anticipate higher-level manageability (layer-level as opposed to class-level). It's for this reason why layered model is preferred for projects with more than 500,000 LOC. The paper does not give information about each individual project, only about whole group.","courseId":172,"phaseId":4,"postId":49278,"postCreationTime":1242782988,"courseCategoryId":15,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Spring\/09 Archive","postParentId":49251,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306578"},"forumId":1016,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":17319,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 S09","postTitle":"Re: Case Study:Architectural Complexity of Large-Scale Software Systems","courseCategoryName":"Grad Spring\/09 Archives","topicName":"Case Study:Architectural Complexity of Large-Scale Software Systems"},{"postUserId":1394,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Excellent presentation!  Now, I am really interested in finding out more about the Sotograph tool.

I have a couple of questions: Does it appear that the selection of Java systems was coincidental, or was it intentional, perhaps limited by the capability of the Sotograph system? Is it possible that this biased the results? A comment on Figure 7: this graph would be much more useful with a logarithmic scale in the x-axis. As it is, the vast majority of systems - those with less than 400,000 LOC - are clustered at the lower left, making the data points nearly indistinguishable. A key issue for me was that the author clearly attaches significance to the choice of system architecture, with a high degree of correlation between architecture and erosion patterns, to the extent that the two systems with no definable architecture are assessed as \"100% eroded\". Does \"poor architecture\" only sometimes contribute to \"high erosion\", or is there actually a causal relationship between the two? In other words, has the author inadvertently defined erosion in this context as \"quality of initial architecture choice\", rather than \"amount of drift from architecture\"? To address the latter question, I suggest a future research idea: rather than select systems apparently at random, the researcher should target examples of specific architectures, and review for erosion. This might show more variability between systems of the same architecture, rather than showing architecture itself as the primary variable.

It is also true cross-platform development language as opposed to C++ where you would have to recompile programs based on architecture you were running. I think that projects that were chosen were the ones that were developed in firm author was working in. Since that firm is closely associated with university, their language of choice was most likely java. I think that should other language been in place of java, results of study would change but not a lot as the study was concentrated on architecture and not on performance or resource management. General conclusions would be same. Author defined criteria for erosion based on complexity of the software structure. Since interviews were used to identify such criteria the amount of erosion would be awarded based on how well developers understand architecture ( understanding general structure, understanding to a point of introducing changes and understanding naming convention). So if a group of developers can identify architecture fast and easily, the given project is subjected to less software erosion. Otherwise project is treated as subjected to higher levels of software erosion.

Your personal observations section was good. The evaluation of erosion by the author was weak. I, like you and others, had issues with the way the author used the measure. To judge it based on team members' ability to describe the architecture and the desire to redevelop the entire system was problematic. If developer turnover is high then the system will always be judged to have strong erosion. You suggest, in your response to Tony that 20-30 independent developers make that judgment. But how about regressing number of change requests successfully implemented (as an indicator of maintainability and level of erosion) to independent variables such as use of layered architecture (without cycles), reference architectures, ..., size of system, application problem domain, use of outsourcing, ... ? I think that approach might address some of Christopher's concerns as well. What do you think? It sure would be nice to see an empirical study that ranked drivers of maintainability to see where architectural complexity fits in as I am not that comfortable accepting the author's statement that architectural style is pivotal when it comes to maintainability.

I must point out that little is known about conditions in which this projects were developed so if author has that information at hand then it would assist on developing metrics based on your idea. Also sample size of projects would most likely have to be increased as not all variables would be applicable to every project. Finally variables would have to be proven truly independent and not be part of a relationship (size of the system may be related to application problem domain as some of the problems such as operating system to operate a space shuttle would require large system development by default) As far as importance of architectural style being important when it comes to maintenance I like to think of it in terms of cars. If you build a car with sound architecture and cheap parts--you would end up with a cheap car with a low reliability. If you build car with poor design and high-quality parts you would end up with an assembly of expensive high quality parts that no one would be able to drive.

I agree, there wasn't much in the paper on performance. It would have been nice to see more details in their implementation section. The authors did say that they used on open source html parser for the web pages and that the Winner Takes All algorithm was implemented in MATLAB. A quick analysis shows that the parse tree traversal and encoding of the web page is cheap with respect to time, O( n ), where n is the number of tags. But building the Levenshtein distance matrix is O( p^2 ) in time where p is the number of pages. As for the Self Organizing Map (SOM), for each learning sample you have to do comparisons to each neuron to get the best match and then do a quick and cheap update of only the neighborhood neurons. Anyway, based on the last sentence in their paper, where they talk about comparing different clustering algorithms, I am concluding that performance is going to be addressed in one of their future papers. The authors combined the precision and recall measurements in the F-measure quantity. The formula for it is 2*(precision*recall)\/(precision+recall) and for perfect, precision and recall it is going to be at its maximum of 1. This is the quantity that they are optimizing. Implicit in the formula is an equal weighting for precision and recall and that is where my objection comes in. If your job is to reengineer a web site and you are trying to simplify the generation of the pages then you care more about precision than recall. Wading through many false positive page pairings is going to be more expensive than missing a few pages that could potentially be combined. The authors used the web application pages, of the systems under test, during training passes as input and then stopped iterating through the input when  the network settled.  Hope that helps.

I have never been a web developer, so the concepts in the presentation were a bit foreign to me. In your presentation, you mentioned that this clustering algorithm was used to identify similar pages at the structural level. I don't understand how identifying pages at the structural level can help in web application re-engineering. So I did some research and realized that the distance between web pages can be based on the content and the structure of the document. And the distance between web pages are used in web search and classification tools. Would you please elaborate a bit more on the implication of identifying structurally similar pages on web application maintenance and re-engineering? And for those of you who are like me, do not know too much about web development, this article helped me in understanding the concept of \"structure similarity of web documents\". http:\/\/www.cs.uic.edu\/~ifc\/grants\/ep98.pdf Tong","courseId":172,"phaseId":3,"postId":49296,"postCreationTime":1242804563,"courseCategoryId":15,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Spring\/09 Archive","postParentId":49151,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306587"},"forumId":1016,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":17322,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 S09","postTitle":"Re: Identifying Similar Pages in Web Applications Using a Competitive Clustering Algorithm","courseCategoryName":"Grad Spring\/09 Archives","topicName":"Identifying Similar Pages in Web Applications Using a Competitive Clustering Algorithm"},{"postUserId":1329,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Tong, To try and answer your question I'll provide a top down perspective that includes your comment on distance between pages. Ideally, for ease of maintenance, the end goal is to generalize cloned pages in one cluster into a single page. That way modifications only need to be done in one place. Thus maintenance costs are reduced. The challenge is then to identify cloned pages. There are several potential dimensions to use to make that decision in a pattern recognition scheme. As you indicated structure and content could be used. Others include navigation paths out of the page and client side scripts associated with the page. The authors of the paper focused on structure. I would like to have seen them use other dimensions as well. But they already did a lot of work to get it as far as they did. I find this area interesting as it is applicable to other endeavors as well. The trick seems to be to find the right set of input dimensions to use for the classification process. For face recognition, things like eye socket and nose proportions can be useful. For those darn marketing systems, age, gender, occupation, home postal\/zip code and the like seem useful. Hope that makes it a bit clearer. BTW if you are interested in how some of these notions can be used for search take a look at the Brin and Page (founders of Google) paper titled, \"The Anatomy of a large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine\".

I have a few comments\/questions: The authors describe cloning as a serious problem, one that afflicts large and small systems to an increasing degree over time. An alternative view is that this is actually the point, that a professional website should employ a standard look-and-feel throughout, in order to present a consistent and familiar interface to the user. Surely the authors are not suggesting that all pages should be unique, but what balance between uniqueness and similarity is appropriate - is it even possible to assign value to the concept of cloned pages without that assessment? I had an issue with the comparison algorithms - they assume that the benchmark clustering is \"correct\", and compare performance of the prototype tool against it for precision\/recall. This creates a problem if the initial assumption is faulty - for example, the poor results found in Case Study #1 could be the result of an inability of the \"experts\" to cluster the pages consistently, rather than a failure of the algorithm. Was there a feeling that consensus was difficult to reach on the SEKE system, or that it wasn't strong? Also, you note that for Case Study #1, the process was \"not that useful... this is unfortunate, because this application is probably in greater need of automated program comprehension tools\". This is an interesting (and likely true) point, but was the application poorly written, or is this simply an indication that there was a low percentage of cloned pages? In other words, was this application truly \"worse\"? Or, given the results, is this simply an indication that the methodology is only valid for applications with some level of standard structure as well as a significant number of cloned static pages? Given the original intent - to assist in comprehension of Web applications - I suggest future research should attempt to tune the algorithms to provide meaningful information about systems with no inherent structure or page standards. In this context, \"meaningful information\" would be \"information that informs the support engineer\", not necessarily (but not necessarily excluding) \"information about clustering\".

I have been doing Java web application for a couple of year, but never have a chance to do something like this. I guess I did not encounter the problem because I usually rewrite the old web application :-) The comparison of html pages is interesting, but I am not sure how efficient this will be. For example, if we use Struts\/Tile, I bet most of pages will be categories to one category because almost all pages are sharing the same title bar, left menu, menu bar, etc. Also, I think the analysis need to involve hyper-link analysis[1]. Secondly, how is the algorithm on pages with AJAX? Currently, more and more web pages are using AJAX technology. Can it also cluster Javascript properly? To reengineer a web application, I believe that clustering is the first step. Do you know what are usually steps after that? Similar pages do not usually mean similar functionalities.

With SREP, the authors propose a common standard for evaluating the security of IS and they point out that the main reason for security problems is that they only dealt with at the implementation stage rather than at the design level. This was a very theoretical paper and the authors failed to include in their research the fact that security concerns are too expensive to be dealt with in the absolute. In practical applications, the amount of security implemented is always relative to the perceived threat. And threats are usually a product of implementation. In our dynamic world the value of assets and threats are constantly changing.

It seems like a lot of the presentation time is devoted to preamble -- introductory stuff, the agenda, and definitions -- and that coverage of the paper itself is rushed as a result. 2. At about 4:50, the definition you give of private data seems pretty narrow. The paper (as you note later) actually provides a great list of the kinds of data that can be considered sensitive. 3. I'm not sure what is meant by privacy tiers (discussed near the 10:00 minute mark). Can you explain? 4.You indicate that missing virtualization coverage is a weak point of the paper. What sort of issues do you think should have been included? 5. Regulatory compliance and data location raise another interesting problem. What happens when the data is spread across jurisdictions where the laws conflict, and full compliance isn't possible. This is very relevant to Canadian companies looking to partner with US cloud providers. Our privacy laws forbid disclosure of many kinds of personal data, while US legislation, especially the Patriot Act, can require US disclosure of the same data to US officials. This paper provides a good overview of the issue: http:\/\/www.computer.org\/portal\/web\/csdl\/doi\/10.1109\/MSP.2008.111. This seems like a good area for future research (it's already a pretty busy one), but perhaps for lawyers, not software engineers. 6.

You brought up very good points, Please see my responses below. Fell free to share your thoughts. 1. Since it is very new upcoming not very matured subject in IT world, Lots of work & researches in the pipeline, and have so many arenas with the questions, I wanted to make sure before I start discussing the paper, I cover the grounds as broad as possible, e.g. People have lots of doubts about Clouds with virtualization, which I tried to cover in slide #8, \u201CCloud Computing Categories\u201D.   2. Pl. correct me if I am wrong, I believe here we are discussing on Slide #9, under \u201CDefinitions\u201D about \u201CData Privacy\u201D? You are right, I actually addressed this very briefly in this slide, here are my reasons and the approach I took to cover in the presentation: I believe the subject projecting type of data to be secured in IT infrastructure is much matured, and there are a plenty of research work is already being done. I see this as a separate topic altogether. For my topic, I wanted to project more on Cloud related approach for implementing the Data Privacy. As a result of this, I discussed this under Analysis subheading of the slide #22 \u201CEvaluation by Author\u201D in more details. 3. Well, here the main objective was to project, distinguishing the approaches for all Software Engineering KAs life cycles completion, keeping Data Privacy in consideration, require to take separate isolated approach at Individual versus Enterprise Organizational tier.             4. I see this, a huge missing brick of the paper. As I discussed briefly on slide #8, \u201CCloud Computing Categories\u201D, the whole Cloud Infrastructure is virtualized in 3 Categories, for end users. Depending upon the virtualized technology used by Cloud vendor to put cloud services together, the life cycle of the software engineering KAs will be changed. E.g. Is cloud vendor using Server hardware virtualization or not, Is storage virtualization being used, Is Network Virtualization being used, etc. If so, the approaches to deal with issues raised by these varieties of virtualization technologies will be completely different. 5. True, I completely agree on this. And I see lots of research is required, to address the questions raised in the fields on this. Lawyers need to take big part roles with Software Engineers as a part of the research. It is very sensitive and would be difficult specially dealing across the borders between US & Canada, but I am very positive on this, since at least these two countries work out very friendly dealing in common developments. And once the examples will be set between US & Canada, then with the template approach it will open up ventures for the rest of the world. 6. I strongly believe that\u2019s where the industry is moving, towards clouds with privacy. Yes it will require a variety of template approach for privacy patterns. It is also discussed in the paper, and I also included this in my presentation. Lots of work is required to generate these pattern templates.

These software services not only have an Acknowledgement agreement along with users consensus listed before the usage of the software service, It must have defined in very simple language with the examples of the agreement. So that there will be no room left for assumptions, which I believe is a gray area, and most of the user community gets trapped in. *** As a Security standpoint, my belief is that cloud architecture require to stand alone and not as an appendage on an established IT infrastructure. Since the core of Cloud Computing is the virtualization of IT components, and with my experience as a project technical lead to deploy hardware virtualization for State of WA, I got an opportunity to dive deep in it, and came across with very strong experiences in the domain of isolation of virtualization and standalone established IT infrastructures. And cloud is even one more additional layer of complexity on Virtualized IT structure. Whole bunch of SLAs, legal documentation, product life cycle researches, processes, procedures, needs to be established with separate attention as compared to established IT infrastructure.

One of the issue I see with cloud computing is Security. Security can be a very serious issue in this case because data spread across multiple organisations and in multiple domains how would the obligations of the Freedom of Information Act and Data Protection work? This sort of system would remove both the hesitance to be dependent on one single company and force the cloud to move to a more generalized model. Of course it opens up a pandora's box of privacy and security concerns. Second issue I see with cloud computing is from the business side. As soon as Google for example is involved companies are justifiably hesitant to build on something provided by a competitor and Google is pretty much competing with everyone these days. In the long run I think it is reasonable to assume that cloud computing should become like the power grid you just plug in and pay a bill for your usage. You don't have to negotiate a contract with a specific power plant or even power Generation Company. That process is dealt with by the middle man that you pay your bill to.

All the Infrastructure equipment, what we see today\u2019s life in our physical location require to be virtualized. And instead of investing in purchasing the physical equipment, it will be available in the virtualized based services. E.g. if one needs to setup a small business with IT infrastructure, Vendors will be available with Virtual routers, switches, firewalls, Mail servers, database servers, file print servers etc. And before setting up these virtual IT infrastructure prerequisite Software Engineering matrixes needs to be available. These Software Engineering virtualized services will complete the whole Knowledge Area research work, and will suggest you the required information. Ultimately end user will need only a slim Tab with High speed internet access. Industry is not there yet, but with the speed of the changes in IT are happening, I do not see these all very far. Google has a very good model of business. Google invest big time in its crew.

As you stated, their privacy policy is very generic. All organizations will have to develop a policy and all applications in the cloud have to offer solution.

Weather it is PAAS, SAAS or IAAS, as a first defense, protecting cloud services starts from clients web browsers.  The most effective way to ensure users are adequately authenticated when using browsers to access services in the cloud, is to facilitate an additional authentication factor outside of the browser (in addition to username\/password). Which is essentially multi-factor authentication, but available options today are rather limited when considering requirements of scalability and usability. The aspect of designing and implementing effective user authentication was the focus of my recently published article, \"Strong User Authentication On the Web\", as part of the 16th edition of the Architecture Journal. The article discussed a few viable options at implementing \"strong\" user authentication for end users in the cloud (not limited to multi-factor authentication), and an architectural perspective on many of the capabilities that together form a strong authentication system. ******** 3 - Organizational Data security in cloud is a very sensitive issue. Organization, storage, management of the data has always been an issue, irrespective of data stored in cloud or not. Adding one more layer of cloud on top of this becomes even more challenging.  A cloud based BPM application allows people to access the application no matter where they are, but may have a harder time accessing an internal document repository. Of course, if you are part of a completely cloud based organization (including your document repository) that won't be an issue, for an on premise BPM application - vice-versa. A need of a strong collaboration between BPM application & Documents management systems providing a secure access is the key. ****** 4 - Here is an interesting article with a detailed explanation: http:\/\/www.bpminstitute.org\/articles\/article\/article\/business-process-models-business-rules-and-the-decision-model-how-they-should-work-together.html ******** 5 - Here are a couple of articles addressing some aspects of application integration: http:\/\/www.bpminstitute.org\/articles\/article\/article\/service-oriented-business-applications.html http:\/\/www.bpminstitute.org\/articles\/article\/article\/out-soa-cing-the-challenge-of-outsourcing-soa.html *********** Additional Reference: http:\/\/0-portal.acm.org.aupac.lib.athabascau.ca\/citation.cfm?id=1845385&CFID=7913493&CFTOKEN=17490868&preflayout=flat Thanx Manish","courseId":245,"phaseId":3,"postId":73300,"postCreationTime":1296659391,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73160,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d30976c"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23740,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: BPM in Cloud","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"My Presentation"},{"postUserId":5748,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Manish, Thanks for your response.

Your intend of providing Cloud Computing background to audience is great, but it cutting your time on the research paper itself - which may be one of the reasons causing you spending less time on few important pieces (will provide my points later). 2. From vendor and research organization include Information (or Data) as a Services also part of Cloud Computing. If the focus of the paper is privacy, I suggest to include it. 3. Cloud Computing is a deployment platform, and it could be implemented as Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud. Even the Public Cloud, it could be Dedicated Cloud using a non-shared platform. For sure, it costs more. 4. I feel some valuable pieces of information could be explained more: 4.1 Personal or Sensitive information definition. Author gave a great summary, which include PII, usage and others. 4.2 Five (5) Different Phase of Project. Example: most organization pay attention to build, but may forget about the handling of decommisioned applications which still have many sensitive information. 4.3 Top Tips for Software Engineering. Example: Minimize personal information sent and stored over the cloud. When organization using SaaS, a business function could be composed using services from more than one service vendor. If we allow person information sent back\/forth between services has risk. One approach is using surrogated (or artificate) key and keep information at central. 5. Cloud Computing could leverage virtualization, but not necessary relies on virtualization. I agree with author leaving the implementation of Cloud Computing out of scope and focus on the key concern - privacy. Also, Cloud Computing does not necessary to have SaaS running on PaaS, which running on IaaS. 6. I view Data Privacy is a mandatory Non-Functional Requirement, therefore, it is covered in the solution architecture and all the development phases. 7. As many others point out, legal is a key one. If an services vendor bankrupt and\/or acquired, who own the data. If the data owner lost the ownership, what will be the liability (consequnce).

Pl. see my response below: As I already mentioned in one of my responses: Since it is very new upcoming not very matured subject in IT world, Lots of work & researches in the pipeline, and have so many arenas with the questions, I wanted to make sure before I start discussing the paper, I cover the grounds as broad as possible, e.g. People have lots of doubts about Clouds with virtualization, which I tried to cover in slide #8, \u201CCloud Computing Categories\u201D. 2. This was the main objective of including the definition slide #8 \u201CCloud Computing Categories\u201D along with the slide \u201CDefinition of problem\u201D of the presentation. No matters what type of services in cloud will be offered irrespective of PAAS, SAAS or IAAS, Organizational tier of data privacy will always be required at the highest level. 3. This would be a very interesting discussion. In the beginning, I thought to include it, and then realized the core purpose of presenting privacy topic will become more of \u201CTypes of Clouds\u201D topic. Yes for sure dedicated cloud in contrast with generic available cloud services will cost fortune. All the cost of implementing of KAs for Software Engineering will be under one head, and again TCO will have only one ROI. In order to justify this huge cost, Organization needs to be at expanded Enterprise level functionalities. 4.1. This was the main reasons of including the slide \u201CDefinition of problem\u201D of the presentation explaining Data Protection supporting with HIPAA & SOX compliancy. These two model support International level of Personal & Organizational with Privacy & Data Security measures, at production usage of research and implantation models. 4.2. HIPAA & SOX compliancy model projects a very detailed modules & processes to handle the decommissioning approaches towards hardware, software, information and other components of the systems. 4.3. I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable storing all the personal information at a central location, that would cause single point of failure and in the event of unavailability of the resources, whole cloud goes down. That would not be a safe approach. I would rather go for different approaches between distributed model and pass on demand model. 5. This is the present cloud Industry model, Cloud computing does not necessary to have SAAS running on PAAS which running on IAAS.  How I see this as, Cloud services offered by following this model could have maximum ROI with very little TCO. By using the dynamic capabilities of virtualization, you are actually using the infrastructure at the maximum capacity. E.g. you will be surprised that in traditional datacenters, with non-virtualized infrastructure 85% of the infrastructure is at waste using all production resources. I am not saying people are not evaluating their infrastructure need carefully; this is how the typical traditional non-virtualized model is. 6. True, this was the main objective of including slide#18 \u201CProposed Approach Research & Methodology\u201D, explaining privacy practices for the Process Actors of the Software Requirement of the SWEBOK KAs. By adding the privacy practices for each Process Actors, ensures that Privacy is taken care at very granular levels. 7. I visualize a model of services offered in cloud as another cloud. So basically multiple vendors are virtualized clouds in another cloud. This model provides complete resiliency & redundancy. It would take a long time in future to come up with.

I couldn't find HIPAA and SOX referenced in the research paper; and the I don't see author limited himself\/herself to HIPAA and SOX only.  It is you added value to leverage both as the compliance.  Information privacy is a due care of any responsible organization regardless whether they need to conform the HIPAA and SOX or not. 2. Central site by no means SPOF.  Centeral site mean site(s) owned by the organizations, i.e. not external.  It could have one or mulitple data center (location).  It means the organization does not require to concern about the ownership and control by other organization. 3. Simply using ROI to justify the solution without considering risk factors is incomplete.  Many organization use off-shore computing to save money years ago; and some change their mind to switch back the services because of quality.  You mention one keyword in the presenation, elasticity, this is one of the key stenght of Cloud.  More important, the research is about privacy, not TCO.  Privacy information disclosure or leaking is a risk. 4. You use the phase \"virtualized cloud in another cloud\".  It is a recusive (or self-reference) statement.  Without proper definition of cloud, it is difficult to comment.  My simplified definition of cloud is \"assured services delivered through a black-box apporach\", i.e. you don't need to know the implemented mechanism.  It is similar to the cloud of X.25, MPLS network, you don't need to know the physical route - it will route and deliver.

The topic of the presentation was more on Privacy, not implementing security, but privacy & security modeling goes side by side.

An organization starting their security\/privacy modeling, HIPAA & SOX provides god templates as starting point. Yes, if the organization\u2019s operations are large enough to support its repositories across globe, it would be a solution for consideration. In case of government or the organizations which do not want to spend energy & resources hosting their repositories in the premises owned by them across the globe, would be challenging.

If I had to do it, I think I would focus detailed planning only on the predictable next step, (e.g. if we are in design, plan for this design step and the subsequent evaluation step, when we move to that evaluation step, plan for whatever step we are going to next). It might be that managing a Star Process life cycle would require Star Process Management Tools. I think many of the techniques used in Agile, such as short sprints, scrums, etc. could be applied in a star process, if the overriding framework was adapted slightly.

The ability to jump laterally to another task in project development might feel very unnatural to an experienced programmer. Quite frankly, I don't think programmers should have to worry, or even be aware of development models or methodologies. My personal feeling about applying Agile is, to borrow a line from a popular film, \"The first rule of Agile development is you don't talk about Agile development\".

A few closely related questions that if you want to don't hesitate to wrap it up into one answer. It seems that the authors are really trying to deal with the inability of the stakeholders to document their requirements as (from my experience) there are far too many details that are hard to imagine. Would you agree? It seems that the authors form of prototyping is not with an iteration of actual code base but rather with modeling tools. If I got that right does that mean it will be faster to get agreement of what is required between stakeholders and developers and is this the advantage? Is it true that this approach tries to solve crossing the real chasm (somewhat wide) between stakeholders and developers today? For web based products anyway. Perhaps stakeholders are primarily marketing people with little ability to comprehend the underpinnings of technology and thus the reason for this approach. Is this too general or often the case? Therefore could we say that this is a truly innovative approach that we welcome as developers?

The first was the fact that communication was not considered as some sort of constraint for the 24 hour model.  I guess this is because the proposed system focused strictly on task scheduling.  Clearly future work would need to be done to integrate the challenges associated with communication at a global level. The second was the challenge of coordinating activities.  If this model is to be utilized to its full potential, a person in one time zone should be able to 'hand off' what they had completed during their 'shift' to a person in the next time-zone so that the work could continue 24h\/day.  Did the authors indicate that the tasks were mutually exclusive in this study?  Or did they provide any indication that a task would be shared among people across the three zones?

The author did not mention that the tasks were mutually exclusive. From the provided project execution model, it looks like the tasks are interconnected. However, the author assumes that a task will be a low level task so only one person will execute it. Bigger tasks are broken down in to smaller tasks, so one person work on one task instead of many. There is only a one to one relationship between a task and a resource. Once that task is completed, the next task in the queue will be executed by a person from another time zone to utilize the 24-h day development model if that task does not have a resource dependency.  In summary, a task will not be shared among resources, however, tasks will be shared among resources regardless of where the resource reside.

I had a question for most of the presentation about overlap, and you went and spoke to it at the end.

What happens if someone in timezone 1 is sick or their productivity is way down and it impacts the person in timezone 2 who is supposed to take up the task in the next time slot? I suppose it would be at discretion of the project manager whether or not the algorithm be reapplied and the work tasks be reallocated, reoptimizing the schedule taking into account the new conditions. They could either do that, or stay the course and hope to get back that lost time somehow. The other thing that came to mind was the fact that as a programmer you'd have your window of time to work on the project, but then you'd have to go home and have a life.

Or would you consider developing something similar? Or did you conclude that it is interesting, but not appropriate? And why not? Well basically it would come down to a few options. Distributed framework (component, agent, CORBA...) SOAP transport through HTTP Direct socket communication XML-RPC I think that I would go with direct socket communication to a Linux server running databases and applications centrally. For a couple of reasons. First in a developing country you have to think about ease of maintenance above all. A distributed application is fairly more complicated then the other alternatives. Second I don't see any advantages of going with a distributed framework in my case. I will not be using tools that were designed and implemented separately making them non inter operable. I will be writing everything from scratch as simple as possible. As my application grows (if it ever does) and if I ever have to connect to external other related tools then a distributed framework will be worth looking into but I would go with open source solutions such as omniORB for Python as oppose to their custom proposed solution. SOAP and XML-RPC are the slowest options albeit probably easier then CORBA which might explain their popularity. however, I found the concept of layers being presented as silos a bit confusing.

Maybe that common knowledge comes from the common three-tier architecture where the data layer never interacts with the presentation layer and vice versa. Both layers go through the logic layer first. That makes that particular layered architecture linear. But not all layered architecture are linear. Take the MVC (Model - View - Controller) for instance. The view can be directly updated by the model without going through the controller which makes it a triangular layered architecture.

First let me say that claiming \"more mature\" might have been a little premature on my part. I assumed that since there existed projects already with people working on them that that would make them \"more mature\". That's not necessarily true. However, some open source alternatives are more widely used which have many advantages over a framework developed and used by only one project. In addition, in theory the open source alternatives are not really direct replacement for the 3CoFramework. The 3CoFramework is a component-based framework with some added features among which the most important one is that it can directly link with the layered architecture used at design stage. But the way I see it is that in practice the difference between the 3CoFramework, another component-based framework, and an agent-based framework is pretty slim. I even had to extend my research a little to find out the difference between them. They really are all abstractions or encapsulations. An interesting research[1] I found on this used \"communication\" to define and differentiate a component, agent and object. But even there, component and agent are still relatively similar. So finally to answer your original question I would say that I would probably go with something like JADE in Java or omniORB in Python. Of course, like the authors mentioned one tricky part was to integrate several tools not originally design to inter operate together. I don't have enough practical experience to know if JADE and omniORB would be a good fit in that case. Maybe a little bigger nutshell than you expected but I hope that it was satisfying enough.

Agent abstraction: - Blackboard communication - Message-based communication - Intra Place communication - Mobile Place communication Component abstraction: - Same language component communication - Framework communication Object abstraction: - Same language communication - Different Language \/ Machine communication It's worth also noting that other researchers say they are identically: \"One person\u2019s \u201Cintelligent agent\u201D is another person\u2019s \u201Csmart object\u2019; and today\u2019s \u201Csmart object\u201D is tomorrow\u2019s dumb program [2]\" Regards, -- GH [1] Deugo, D.

I do agree with Mohammed regarding the layered architecture that each layered should be talking to only adjacent layers. Also, I am wondering why do authors need this layered architecture at all? Does the component framework good enough? Here again similar question. I'll first refer you to the above discussion on the same subject. Maybe the authors need to provide more clarification on this in future work on this research. However, you did add an interesting point. Isn't the component framework good enough? I asked myself that same question throughout this whole research. Their only argument for this was that it tightly integrates the software architecture used at the design stage with the component-based framework used at implementation stage. They also say that using a layered architecture with a Architecture Description Language enables them to integrate tools that were NOT meant to be inter operable when they were individually designed. I feel it adds complexity where maybe its not necessary but I would need more related practical experience to be comfortable arguing my point of view here. 2. The title mentioned this model is distributed, does it mean that all components are distributed in different layers? otherwise, I don't see any distribution. Components are distributed physically like any other distributed system. I think the authors used the layered architecture mainly to organize services (components and connectors) into well defined layers or categories. 3. The problem authors mention is multidisciplinary areas located on different computers, embedded devices, GPS, etc. But the solution is a web-based solution. How does the web-based solution solve the problem in embedded system? This question is not quite clear to me. Let me know if I did not get it. Data and other related tools come from multidisciplinary areas. The web-based is merely the GUI for the decision makers to interact with the system. Data and other related tools can come from anywhere including embedded systems. JADE can have a smart agent on an embedded system and I'm sure they have the same capabilities in their framework. 4. I really don't see the difference between the proposed framework and agent-based framework except different terms (3Co vs agent).

I was expecting it for some reason ;) I haven't actually researched any peer reviewed papers with performance comparisons on competing technologies for distributed applications. However, I did come across a nice clear benchmark testing article on the Internet [1]. I don't have my computer with me now but I was intending on replicating the benchmark with all the newest versions of each of the tools used within the next few days. They used Python as the programming language which is also my development language of choice most of the time. The overhead of parsing XML used in SOAP and XML-RPC is the main factor in being the slowest options. But because of its ease of use in data sharing between various different systems XML is widely used and is likely there to stay. I'll let you know if the same benchmark with new and improved frameworks results in significantly different performance than at the time of writing the article but my guess is that it will be very similar.

Not a lot. They only say that, for instance regarding ADL, existing ones are able to abstract the software architecture of an application system into components and their interactions (connectors) and can provide formal specifications for interactions. They say that it is not enough to view complex systems simply as components and connectors. For that, they say the hierarchical view consisting of layers can more effectively organize the data and other related tools. There is very little comparison and I was a little disappointed at that. It's still not very clear to me \"why\" its better. Is their ADL universal and abstract enough to be reused with other frameworks? They claim openess throughout their research paper. Now it's not clear if their custom ADL (xSADL) is compatible with other component-based framework or only with a component-based framework that follows their 3CoFramework. I am under the impression it's the latter. They also say on their website <http:\/\/greenleaf.unl.edu\/greenleaf_project\/faces\/user\/index.jsp> that their \"open components\" can be used by others in their own projects. Also is their software open-source and can it be adapted to solve other tasks Very good question. The project has just recently been renamed to GreenLeaf project. At first glance it looks more like a collection of open source projects put together forming a bigger smarter system. They make use of GRASS GIS which is licensed under the GNU\/GPL version 3 which I think is the most viral open source license out there. If they add to the project and distribute to someone (which they do by providing the NADSS to its stakeholders) they would be required to distribute their source code as well. But maybe they simply use GRASS (and other projects) as users and not necessarily add and integrate their own code into the project. Either way, they do say on their site that other people can make use of their \"open components\" in other projects. However, their website is not a typical proper open source project with download links, bugs tracking system, browse SVN, and all that. I feel there is more work to be done if they intend on making their project an open source project people will opt to adopt as it is not very clear how to proceed for someone interested in the project. And I have worked with MANY open source frameworks and applications. Also it would be interesting to know how would such software co-ordinate dataflow and data management so that distributed network would be using its resources efficiently. Excellent question. From what I know of other frameworks such as JADE this is usually handled at the framework level and the application programmer can focus on the messages being sent and received all over the place instead. The research paper does not provide enough thorough details of the system to understand this very important aspect. I have tried to find more in-depth information on this (something like JADE provides on their site) but did not find any. Sorry this is as much feedback I can provide even with further research. I hope it provides you with at least enough information should you need or want to dig further this important issues you raised.

And since according to them at the time of the writing they were the only ones working on such a solution, yes it could very well be a part of their motivation. I'm wondering if their component framework might have potential commercial applications outside their own proposal? Good question and a little hard to answer. They say their system is \"open\" and that others can use it in their own project. Now does that mean that people will? Hard to say.

It should be like any open source project where it's easy to download, install, and try the system. You should be able to browse the source code on their site, bugs and feature request tracker and all that. None of that is there (or I couldn't find it anyway) and that might turn off many potential users. Also the fact that, although their solution might be brilliant, it might be too hard to implement and maintain in practice.

However, if you think about it, the source code of a program can be modeled in a relational sense; particularly the structure. Then the techniques described could in theory be applied. Let\u2019s briefly (very briefly) look at how the first few phases of a compiler works: Phase 1) The Scanner performs lexical analysis by transforming the source code (string of characters) into meaningful units (called tokens). In this phase discovered identifiers are added to the symbol table (functions, variables, constants, data types), and literals to the literal table (a literal is a value such as \u201Chello world\u201D). Phase 2) The Parser receives the sequence of tokens from the Scanner and performs syntax analysis to determine the programs structure; this produces a syntax tree (see below). Phase 3) Semantic Analysis annotates the syntax tree with extra bits of information deduced from analysis of the syntax tree and the symbol\/literal tables. At this point you should be able to see the potential data models surfacing from the source code. In a quick and crude relational sense, the above function could be modeled as follows (where a one-many relation exists between the function and parameter table): Function (PK)Function ID Name Algorithm Return Data Type Parameter (FK)Function ID Name Data Type Hope that helps. ~Aaron","courseId":119,"phaseId":2,"postId":35221,"postCreationTime":1201575546,"courseCategoryId":8,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/08 Archive","postParentId":35207,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d305af1"},"forumId":720,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":12780,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W08","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 - Week4 - Semi-automatic model integration using matching transformations and weaving models","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/08 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 - Week4 - Semi-automatic model integration using matching transformations and weaving models"},{"postUserId":1352,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Aaron, Transformation tools certainly provide a quick way to data transformation needs. Can you provide some scenarios where we can apply this transformation model on a lerger scale?

I also found another paper with the same author that present the concepts quite nicely: Jossic, A.; Del Fabro, M.D.; Lerat, J.-P.; Bezivin, J.; Jouault, F., \"Model Integration with Model Weaving: a Case Study in System Architecture,\" Systems Engineering and Modeling, 2007. ICSEM '07. International Conference on , vol., no., pp.79-84, 20-23 March 2007 Abstract: Complex metamodels are often decomposed into several views, in particular for architecture framework metamodels such as DoDAF (Department of Defense Architecture Framework). Designing models that conform to this kind of metamodels implies data integration problems between the different views. Usually, different views from a same metamodel share a common core. This is the reason why those views are interrelated The common core is identified with the creation of mapping links. Within MDE (model driven engineering) approaches, these links may be captured, by weaving models. Using MDE principles, we automate this data integration process by generating transformations between these views. For this, we generate weaving models between different views using matching heuristics and then we produce model transformations from this weaving model. We have applied this method to DoDAF metamodels. In this architecture framework, SV-5 (a system view) relates to OV-5 (an operational view) and SV-4 (another system view) with the aim to provide a traceability matrix about system architectures. https:\/\/aupac.lib.athabascau.ca\/validate\/http%3A%2F%2F0-ieeexplore.ieee.org.aupac.lib.athabascau.ca%3A80%2Fiel5%2F4243704%2F4243705%2F04243721.pdf%3Fisnumber%3D4243705%26prod%3DSTD%26arnumber%3D4243721%26arnumber%3D4243721%26arSt%3D79%26ared%3D84%26arAuthor%3DJossic%252C%2BA.%253B%2BDel%2BFabro%252C%2BM.D.%253B%2BLerat%252C%2BJ.-P.%253B%2BBezivin%252C%2BJ.%253B%2BJouault%252C%2BF.","courseId":119,"phaseId":2,"postId":35400,"postCreationTime":1201853793,"courseCategoryId":8,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/08 Archive","postParentId":35242,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d304a0a"},"forumId":720,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":12780,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W08","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 - Week4 - Semi-automatic model integration using matching transformations and weaving models","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/08 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 - Week4 - Semi-automatic model integration using matching transformations and weaving models"},{"postUserId":3918,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"I\u2019d like to make a couple conceptual observations. The first observation I\u2019d like to make is about MDE, and may help in understanding this particular problem domain. The compiler for C++ was written in the procedural language C, and the compiler for Java was written in C++; Java represents the maturity of the OOP paradigm, and to reach this point \u201Cwe\u201D created better tools with tools we had previously built. Once Java came into play UML followed close there-after; UML represents the beginnings of the Model Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm. The shift to MDE requires the initial tools to be built using OOP. However, a goal for MDE should be to build a modeling tool that can then be used to completely build an even better tool; thus maturing the paradigm. To further this concept a little more, in an MDE design any alteration to composition (aggregation) and\/or classification (inheritance) will result in a transformation from the \u201CPrevious Model State\u201D to the \u201CNew Model State\u201D; assuming of course that data has been attached to the Models structure \u2013as would be the case if you were using the MDE tool to rebuild itself.","courseId":119,"phaseId":2,"postId":35294,"postCreationTime":1201680825,"courseCategoryId":8,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/08 Archive","postParentId":35204,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d30204c"},"forumId":720,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":12780,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W08","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 - Week4 - Semi-automatic model integration using matching transformations and weaving models","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/08 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 - Week4 - Semi-automatic model integration using matching transformations and weaving models"},{"postUserId":1320,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Aaron, Great presentation - you spoke clearly and confidently - well done. A quick comment and question. I agree with you that the paper would have been better if they split the theory and implementation in two different papers. Nonetheless, in their implementation, was there any benchmarking on the time\/performance of the transformations? The results gave 306 tuples produced with no restrictions. The UML models the author's used as their example were very simple and small. On a model of any significant size the Cartesian product for the weaving would be very large (assuming no restrictions). With restrictions the tuples were reduced to 12 which was much better but still we're dealing with a simple model. Perhaps speed was not really a concern but I was thinking how this transformation capability could be useful in a real-time\/changing environment.

However, the key performance concern would be the actual execution of the ATL transform rules that are generated by the process described; this could probably be found on the ATL site (mentioned in the thread above). On the other hand, the time required to \u201Cdiscover\u201D the transform rules using the process described, is highly dependent on the algorithms selected to calculate similarity values between elements. Furthermore, I agree with your comment on Cartesian product size; In many cases I would give considerable thought to the idea of an initial interation meant to remove all the immediate matches from further analysis. If \u201Creal-time\u201D discovery is an issue (such as in on-the-fly BI), you could in theory, implement simplified matching algorithms to run as background threads and glean as much as possible; then when sufficient system resources are available have the full version run fill in the blanks. In terms of Data Warehousing, the bottle neck is usually the actual operational source; BCEsis (an Education Student IS) for example, can be reliably extracted about every hour \u2013depending on the time of day. This data can then be conformed and transformed into other sources. But in the case of a DW (unlike BI), the transformation rules may rarely need re-generation if the Data Source schema is relatively constant; a quick iteration of the source\/target schemas could ensure the rules are generated as necessary. As for MDE, transformations could occur in real-time after every model alteration, or as a version patch. MDE has the distinct potential of being able to maintain a change history of every discrete alteration to the model; this change history could then be used to increase the speed and accuracy of the transformation process. ~Aaron","courseId":119,"phaseId":4,"postId":35401,"postCreationTime":1201854352,"courseCategoryId":8,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/08 Archive","postParentId":35396,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d302811"},"forumId":720,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":12780,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W08","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 - Week4 - Semi-automatic model integration using matching transformations and weaving models","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/08 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 - Week4 - Semi-automatic model integration using matching transformations and weaving models"},{"postUserId":1960,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Great presentation.

By choosing to use a particular programming methodology (i.e. XP) you are restricting yourself to follow its guidelines and principals. The case study just presents a method for an implementation of those guidelines and policies that doesn't require people to remember to follow them. The exception reports were not actually part of authors' implementation. Their implementation was to not allow the creation of a class if the class didn't have a corresponding unit test. The people that were testing the implementation wanted the exception reports. Unless I'm misunderstanding the comment, the risk of not following the aspects of a particular programming methodology would be the same as not following that programming methodology without the aspects. The case study does not look at whether one should or should not follow a particular programming methodology, but rather provides a way to follow a chosen methodology more closely. The cost, at least of the sample they gave is two fold, the cost to create the specific implementation could be fairly high, since as pointed out by the authors, detailed knowledge of the IDE was required.

The authors noted there was overhead on loading the eclipse IDE, but aside from that no significant hit to performance while using it. I suppose a particular issue would be that if you use more than one development environment this would not be practical unless all development environments would support integrating process conformance. In fact it would likely require a standard development environment to be used in an organization using this method of process conformance since two different development environments may not be able to support an identical implementation of a particular software process. The conformance can happen at whatever time the pointcuts created for a specific implementation of an aspect indicate. In the sample TestFirst implementation the authors use, it was design time conformance checking, but if the appropriate join points exist, to use to create the pointcuts, it could be done at compile time. It could certainly be done outside the IDE, but this would an additional layer to process conformance checking. Why use some mechanism outside of the IDE when it can be incorporated into the IDE?

Here are my answers to your 3 questions in the same order you asked. 1. Web apps characteristics actually do not facilitate nor make it difficult to gather requirements. What the article is trying to tell us is that it is important to recognize those unique charactersistices of web apps and ensure they are addressed in the requirements gathering and analysis phase. They also find the need to extend some of the existing methodlogies to do so. 2. Gathering requirements through traditional methods such as interviews with customers certainly give us good knowledge as to what they are looking for. However, unless we have a good methodology to follow, we may not ask the right questions or cover all the important aspects of the product\/service. VORD seems to gear us towards following a series of steps to gather the relevent information. VORD is a viewpoint oriented methodology. I think one of the most important aspects of VORD is that it is services oriented, because web apps are also centered around providing services. Through the identification of Viewpoints for instance, we should also be able to easily come up with all the major classes, services (methods), and relationships among them. 3. Very good observation on your part with this question. Authors state that the main problem with VORD as well as most of the existing methodologies was that they failsto align requirements with the business strategy. They believe that this is very important in today's web apps. The solution they propose is basically to extend VORD to capture this. They introduce a new set of \"Web VPs\" to accomplish this.  They heop to gather requirements with respect to navigation, UI, as well as business vision and strategy as well as transactions and operations.","courseId":196,"phaseId":3,"postId":57143,"postCreationTime":1263567414,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57138,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306c65"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19783,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Eliciting Web application requirements \u2013 an industrial case study","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Eliciting Web application requirements \u2013 an industrial case study"},{"postUserId":1394,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Good presentation Anuruthan.

I believe VORD is good because it can be used at the very early stage of requirements gathering and analysis phase to modeling. As for UML, this is a language used to model the system.  This is only good after we identify what the requirements are. But, VORD helps us with identfication part of the requirements phase as well (ie. identifying the VPs) and then structure them around services.  2. The paper is actually concerned with coming up with a solution to elicit requirements for web apps.  RE starts with identifying the requirements (what is the problem) and how to satisfy the requirements (solving the problem) to modeling the solution to some extent. 3. I believe business analysis is similar to RE but RE has a larger scope.  Definitely more research is needed to answer that question.  There are many articles available on just talking about the differences and similarties. example: http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1269902","courseId":196,"phaseId":3,"postId":57414,"postCreationTime":1264011435,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57346,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306ca2"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19783,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Eliciting Web application requirements \u2013 an industrial case study","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Eliciting Web application requirements \u2013 an industrial case study"},{"postUserId":5064,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Anuruthan, I enjoyed watching your presentation.  Being a web developer and business analyst myself, this technique is interesting.  Your presentation was understandable and straightforward.  I understand that Viewpoint Oriented Requirements Definition (VORD) could be a valuable asset to the business analyst in identifying requirements for web applications, although with limitations in its current form.

If we look at some of the reasons mentioned in the article for choosing VORD for web apps, they were that it, 1. is a model designed for highly interactive systems 2. aids in the identification of stakeholders 3. enhances traceability by the explicit association of requirements with VPs 4. structures NFRs around VPs and services So, looking at these reasons for choosing VORD for eliciting requirements, I don't see why we cannot use it for other apps on Windows or Mobile.","courseId":196,"phaseId":3,"postId":57412,"postCreationTime":1264009273,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57411,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306c95"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19783,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Eliciting Web application requirements \u2013 an industrial case study","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Eliciting Web application requirements \u2013 an industrial case study"},{"postUserId":3835,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Anuruthan, This was really interesting!

Having said that, I believe what the article is really concerned about is identifying and eliciting the requirements for a business application as they consider web app as a business application.  Although VORD addresses most of the characteristics of a web app, it does not help capture the organization's business vision and strategy, as well as navigation and UI.

The second part of the question is more subjective as it may be more related to software design or architecture, as well as the strength of the development team; a poorly designed system or a weaker team could potentially introduce issues frequently into a system, however any issues discovered would be addressed faster with a flexible policy than a uniform policy. For the third part of your question, I am not really clear on what you are asking.  A software system may be so unique to a company that an external team would not be an option.  Alternatively, a system maybe so specialized or complex (SCADA systems come to mind), that an internal resource may not be available.  I guess it would depend on the functionality of the system being studied and what would be the best solution for the situation.

Reuse is any replacement effort saved by recycling components (reports, screens, classes, etc.) from a previous current or previous iteration of the system.  The more reusable a system is, the less expensive it will be to replace a system.  Once a system is replaced, there will be less maintenance activities, at least initially, which will reduce the cost of the overall maintenance on the system, which implies that it may be more viable to maintain the system more frequently. IE methodologies = information engineering methodologies.  Here are some links: http:\/\/www.iturls.com\/English\/SoftwareEngineering\/SE_e6.asp http:\/\/www.information-engineer.com\/method.htm http:\/\/condor.depaul.edu\/danderso\/powerp2\/sld021.htm The paper does not say that a degraded system is better.  For degradation, it is directly related to the design of the system.  A poorly structured system will require more maintenance activities, which will cause the system to degrade faster, and benefits a flexible policy.  A well structured system will require less maintenance, and will increase the useful life of the system, which benefits a uniform policy slightly, but the system will still degrade, albeit at a lower rate.  At some point, an organization will begin to analyze replacing a system over continuing to maintain it, and that is what the graph translates to. With the exception of reuse, the authors used empirical studies to setup which parameters would be included in the analytical model.   I am sure that with further studies and research, multiple models will be created with additional parameters for the environment which the system resides.  For now, I would say the results are more precise than accurate.

I suggest the future work is a case study - applying the formula with software vendors - software vendors must maintain the software to fix bug and deliver additional feature to gain the markets.  Therefore, maintenance is mandatory.  At certain point, vendor will decide to replace the current one - the question is what's their decision factors ? Does the decision factors align with the factors included in the research? or have other factors.

Is taxonomy determined at a project level (i.e. different projects can use different taxonomies but run on the same server set up) or the system level (i.e. you need to use the same taxonomy for all projects?  Also, is there a way to determine just by looking at a website which taxonomy it is using?  Maybe there are certain programming languages that lend itself to a particular taxonomy?

Thank you! Technically, one server could run many different application types, but practically speaking, there would be a strong tendency to use a single technology on given server - especially when you consider the use of virtual machines (VMWare, etc.) It's much easier to admin a server running one web technology than multiple. That said, the various frameworks listed are not necessarily incompatible. This is confirmed by the Hybrid and Meta types - which, by design, borrow the 'best of' features from other frameworks and apply them to a particular application. Also, many of the frameworks described in the paper ran as Servlets on the server side. It would be relatively easy to run different servlet-based frameworks on a single application server. On your second question .. You should probably be able to tell an RIA-based site by looking at it. RIAs have a different \u2018look and feel\u2019 to them - they use advanced controls (not just the usual HTML), and seem so much more responsive .. more like a desktop application. Well - sort of. Someone very familiar with a particular component-based framework might be able to recognize the framework by the UI components used. Similarly, you might make an educated guess that a particular application is using request\/response framework by looking at the URLs being sent from your browser, but it might be hard to tell exactly which one. Ultimately, regardless of what web technology is chosen, it must use the browser to display the output. So \u2013 unless the framework departs from web standards (such as what Microsoft web applications often do), there will be limits on how different the application can look and what they can do. -- Donald.","courseId":143,"phaseId":3,"postId":41832,"postCreationTime":1222046869,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":41820,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d305faf"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":15004,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Donald Dutchuk - Taxonomy of Java Web Application Frameworks","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Donald Dutchuk - Taxonomy of Java Web Application Frameworks"},{"postUserId":1338,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Donald, Excellent presentation.

Good questions. First, I should point out that I am not a programmer, and have limited actual experience with these frameworks to give you a 'expert' answer. So .. I will answer them as best I can from the information I came across while researching this assignment, and a little personal experience. Do you think it is possible to apply a frame work for an existing Java web application that has no frame work at all in the beginning? I like this question, as it would seem to be one that many would have regarding their existing applications. Certainly one would have to answer that is IS possible. I think what you are really asking is how hard would it be? It depends on the framework and on how the application was written in the first place. A poorly written application whose individual modules are tightly coupled (highly dependent on one another) would be much more challenging to be converted to a framework. On the other hand, if an application was developed using good programming practices, and especially if it were to be based on a MVC design, then it would be much easier to adopt or integrate a framework. Even under the best scenarios, the effort required would be non-zero, so one would have to identify the motives for doing so. For example, to make the application more maintainable? One should not implement a framework \u2013 even on a new project \u2013 until the benefits have been identified. During the development of a web application , can we change from one frame work to another? Again the effort required would be non-zero, and would depend on which framework, and framework type you currently have, and which you want to move to. So, listed in increasing order of difficulty .. On projects based on Meta frameworks, it would be relatively to substitute functionality from one technology for something else. For example, changing the data persistence layer. Technically this would not be changing the framework though \u2013 just the components within. Meta frameworks are *designed* to make this relatively easy. Changing from a framework based on one type, to another framework based on the *same* type. For example from a request-based to another request-based, or a component-based to another component-based. Changing from a framework of one type, to a framework of another type. Here, it would depend on which types you are moving from and to. Moving from a Request-Based to a pure RIA would be tougher than moving from a pure Component-based framework to an RIA-based framework. As with the first question, there should be clear benefit(s) identified before deciding to change. Thanks for the questions!! -- Donald.","courseId":143,"phaseId":3,"postId":41876,"postCreationTime":1222108650,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":41836,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d305f7c"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":15004,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Donald Dutchuk - Taxonomy of Java Web Application Frameworks","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Donald Dutchuk - Taxonomy of Java Web Application Frameworks"},{"postUserId":4599,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Donald, It was a great presentation, very easy to follow along and it was well presented. Donald\/Bhasker, I am part of a somewhat large organization and one of the inititives they(analysts and programmers in another department within my organization) are going through is to standardize the look and feel of web applications.  So they are converting quite a lot of applications to fit within certain framework. From the status reports I've been reading on this, it seems some of the applications fit really well within the new standards and with some, they are even considering re-designing the application from scratch to conform to the new framework.  So like you mentioned Donald, I guess it's dependent on the type of application and the way it was initially designed. On another note, because of these standardized framework within the organization, it is much easier to program something from scratch using the variou templates in place.

It was your presentation that caused me to pay extra attention to the narration. For me, you've set the standard for being well-spoken and articulate!! The authors didn't really elaborate on why there's a move to open source. Personally, I feel very strongly about open source as a legitimate and preferred approach to creating high-quality software. I'm not sure of the relative number of bugs present in open source vs. proprietary software, but the idea that the open source source-code is out there and available for scrutiny inspires a lot more confidence in me. Call me paranoid, by I'm not sure I trust a vendor to disclose all the bugs in it's closed-source software, or even if they assign sufficient resources to looking. (if you don't look - you don't find?) To me, open source is similar to the peer-review research process that the Comp610 course advocates. In research, there is a steady migration to more complete, and higher quality knowledge because the knowledge is shared and subject to scrutiny. That sounds a lot like open source. You are correct in pointing out that formal support has been an issue with open source. That still may be true to some extent, but many of the major vendors have figured out the there is money to be made by giving away the software and charging for support. That should satisfy customers who need that type of assurance. Still, the 'stigma' remains, for some, that open source is somehow not 'real' software. Their loss.

My criticism of the paper is mainly that it is presented as \u2018research\u2019, yet the methodology used was \u2013 well what methodology *did* they use? They didn\u2019t say why they chose the frameworks they did. They didn\u2019t say why they chose the attributes they used for classification. Nor did they identify the origin of those attributes in the literature. For example, did the authors come up with the terms \u201CRequest-Based\u201D or \u201CComponent-Based\u201D? If not, how\/when did these terms come into the vernacular? What products were the first to introduce those features? But to answer your question .. I think it\u2019s pretty tough to pick one or two attributes to classify these frameworks. The priorities of those who would use the frameworks (and the classification scheme) would likely be quite diverse. For example, a new project might be interested in testing, while an existing project may be interested in compatibility with the current application. I think a table listing the various frameworks available, along with a *comprehensive* list of attributes, is likely to be much more useful (recognizing that this may not be a taxonomy, in the strict definition of the word). Someone interested in using frameworks could review the list of products and attributes, and evaluate the importance of each of those attributes to their own situation. Certainly product maturity and license type would be important attributes to identify, and there are many others: What server infrastructure is needed? What type of support? What language it\u2019s written in? What version is required? Do they provide a component library? What is the URL mapping mechanism? Is a testing framework provided? And on and on .. This may be an instance of where a Wiki would be a preferable way of gathering and presenting this type of information as it can serve as a way of aggregating information from a large number of users, and the information can be updated continuously as products and new versions are released.

Fat clients are the client-side computer of a client-server environment, that have lots of local 'capability' \u2013 processing, storage, graphics, etc. In the case of RIAs, fat clients are able to run JavaScript, or other software locally to enhance the end-users experience. Typically this means fancier graphic interface, and local processing: less data traffic back and forth to\/from the server for a more responsive application. A client PC running an web application located on a web-server would be potentially be a \u2018fat client\u2019 as it has considerable local processing capability. The concept would be realized by the use of RIA software such as AJAX. Contrast that to thin clients, which are essentially just display terminals - most, if not all of the processing is done by the server, and the thin client simply gets input and displays output. -- Donald.","courseId":143,"phaseId":2,"postId":42185,"postCreationTime":1222619535,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":42154,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d302add"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":15004,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Donald Dutchuk - Taxonomy of Java Web Application Frameworks","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Donald Dutchuk - Taxonomy of Java Web Application Frameworks"},{"postUserId":1321,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Christian The authors did not suggest any criteria or methodology to judge the appropriateness of a framework, once it was selected.

This probably isn\u2019t the best way of going about committing to a new technology, but I don\u2019t think most smaller software houses are going to have the resources to formally test a number of technologies and methodically select an appropriate one. My experience is that many employers rely on their employees to try out new technologies (often on their own time, or on \u2018private\u2019 projects) who then bring that new expertise to the table. Certain framework types (like the Meta types described) are likely to be easier to integrate with a custom JavaScript framework such as you describe, but I think it raises an important issue about software quality. Poorly-written in-house libraries* (low cohesion, highly coupled, no standards, etc) are going to be difficult to integrate with any third-party package, and vise-versa.

I wonder if web services frameworks would fall into this taxonomy as another category, or if they're such a different animal, with so many varieties, that it would need its own full broken on taxonomy in parallel to this one. You don't need to answer that. I realize it really comes down to how a person wants to organize the information and what makes the most sense. I haven\u2019t done a lot of work or reading on web services frameworks, but I would think, to be meaningful, it would be best to create a separate taxonomy. The focus of web services is exchanging data between servers (or at least, between applications), whereas the frameworks discussed in this paper were concerned with exchanging data from server to \u2018human\u2019. Obviously there is some overlap, but I think it\u2019s a whole different set of issues at play. 2. Was there any discussion on the cost of upgrading web applications when frameworks are upgraded or merge with another framework? I actually have more familiarity with web services frameworks, and they sure can change fast. I've inherited code that was only a year old and relied on a framework that was at the end of its life cycle ... and it actually merged with another framework.

And there are often benefits to be realized by upgrading to the latest and greatest, as long as its somewhat stable and not bleeding edge.) No \u2013 no such costs were included. I think that would be a hard parameter to include in a taxonomy, as you would need to control many other variables in order to have meaningful results. For example, you would really need to take the same existing application, using the same set of developers, implemented using the various frameworks to be compared, then track the costs associated with making changes. Even then, it would be difficult to \u2018normalize\u2019 the effects of the different levels of expertise of the developers. It\u2019s likely that the \u2018expertise\u2019 of these developers would increase as they complete each upgrade, which would tend to skew the costs in favor of the frameworks studied last. It would be interesting to look a some individual reports on specific upgrades or conversions that were done - to get a feel for the issues. Sounds like you have some familiarity with that. 3. It'd be interesting to include non-Java technologies in this taxonomy. I'd be curious if the categories they came up with are useful when it comes to non-Java frameworks. I can't see that they wouldn't be. The only issue I see here is Microsoft. With such an installed base (IE), they could release a technology that others could not compete with. For example, MS could create a component-based framework with a library of components that only work on Internet Explorer. Hmmm. Come to think of it \u2013 that\u2019s sort of what they did do! 4. When it comes to the RIA-based category and putting together a useful taxonomy, it'd be useful to know what kind of browser support each framework has. Yes \u2013 that would be a good attribute to include in the taxonomy, although I would rather this attribute was framed in terms of 'web-standards compliance'. If the code produced or supplied by the frameworks was compliant, then the focus (of the developers and clients) could shift to using a browser that fully supported web standards.

I wish it did (I mention this as a problem with how the paper was written). The only mention on performance was the measurement of overhead involved in message handling (the messages that went from the client to the server and back again). There is no mention of any overhead involved in the other modules, which I'm sure there would be. They describe the overhead they did measure in units of time only - 69 microseconds. They compared this to an acceptable refresh rate of 200 microseconds and the refresh rate provided by the game Counter-Strike which updates from 10-300 microseconds, both determined by other research. As for why they used Quake 2 and compared it to Counter-Strike, the paper does not indicate. I did a bit of investigating and found the paper that provides information on Counter-Strike is based on the actual network multiplayer online game (MOG). Quake 2 on the other hand seems to be a PC based game. Although it can be played across a network, it is not a true MOG since a MOG is persistent - the world continues to exist even if all players were to sign off (like Counter-Strike would). With Quake 2, one player would invite others to connect to their machine which becomes the 'Server'. Once the game is over, the 'server' ceases, so the game world ends - no persistence. Basically, the authors were simulating a 'central server' game. I doubt that they could get the binaries for counter strike anyway, if they even tried.

Unfortunately I did not have any really good editing software, otherwise I would have tried to even the sound out a bit. As for bullets, I'm not sure where they should not have been used... I beleive MMORPG's will continue to grow, but I see a shift from 'fun' to 'serious' games. Serious games are fun to play, but also teach you something in the process. Games like Quake and Counter Strike don't really teach you anything. New generation games will be eduational and fun at the same time. They are fairly limited at present, but I've read articles where games were used to teach a variety of things (the US military uses games to teach real combat scenarios, not what you'll find in Quake or Counter strike. In the military version, you only get to die once!) Once they become commercial I believe there will be a huge potential market that game developers will have open to them. It might take a while before they become a reality, but I beleive they are on their way.","courseId":196,"phaseId":3,"postId":57387,"postCreationTime":1263942396,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57377,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306ca6"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19845,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: A Challenge for Reusing Multiplayer Online Games without Modifying Binaries","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"A Challenge for Reusing Multiplayer Online Games without Modifying Binaries"},{"postUserId":5739,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"David,          This was a very good presentation, The audio was clear and I could hear properly.

There are 5 primary types of security concerns: 1) Fixed Delay Cheat - a player introduces a delay in packets sent to other players. This results in them getting more time to make decisions; 2) Timestamp Cheat - a player alters the timestamp sent with his actions so they occur before other players actions; 3) Suppressed Update Cheat - purposefully not sending player actions but receiving other players actions - they get to decide how to respond more effectively; 4) Inconsistency Cheat - A player sends inconsistent updates to other players causing players to be booted from the game or to have different actions occur on their machine than on others and 5) Collusion Cheat - two or more players working together rather than in competition with each other. The paper really only addresses the fixed delay cheat. It does so by using a variation of the lockstep sychronization. Basically in this method the game actions cannot occur until all players 'commit' their actions with each other using a cryptographically secure one way hash. Once all players agree, the actual moves are sent as plain text to all other players. The actual method used by the Sychronization module is the Sliding Pipeline Protocol. It works in a similar fashion as lockstep sychronization, it removes some of the acknowledgements in the process. This is done since lockstep sychronization adds too much overhead to the process. It is not foolproof - but it does help. Unfortunately the paper does not define if and how the other security concerns are handled. As for results - I don't think the tests were very conclusive. There were far to few, and the were done in a labratory environment, not the real world. It would be interesting to see how peerbooster would work under real pressure - hundreds of users across the internet.

They were wildly successful (the PC based games). Myst URU (based on Myst\/Riven) was developed to be a server based game. A lot of resources went into research, and it built on a very successful base - all that is required for success. In the end it was a dismal failure. A few articles gave the opinion that it almost caused the developing company to fail. In general once a game goes offline it is dead. Myst URU tried to turn the game over to a small but faithfil fan base. In the end it failed too since there wern't enough resources available to keep it going. As for multiple releases - currently this does not happen too often that I know of (I've seen a few games re-released, but they were PC based games). I'm not sure why they used Quake 2. It could be that it can be played across a network. One player sets up a game - they become the 'server'. Other players join - they become 'clients'. Why Quake was chosen was not stated though. I assume that just about any game that can run over a network would have worked. Playability is definitely tested.

Thanks. I will chime in and say that some serious thought needs to be put into security for this model. In the Quake 2 model, where there is a defined start \/ stop for a game, player state when they join in is not a concern, as that would be defined by the game parameters. But, if a persistent world was joined, player state would (presumably) be stored on the local server version of the game, and transmitted to the remote systems when the player connects to the world. This would let an 'enterprising' player play locally with various cheats to build up their player before connecting to the networked game, coming in with an advantage (even if they performed no cheats once connected). They could even potentially hack the player database on the server to give themselves items or abilities not earned. I can see this technology being able to be used easily for some of the networked games, such as StarCraft, Quake, or any other game that has a relatively short duration with a definite start and stop. I think it would be much more difficult to apply it securely to a game with a persistent world.","courseId":196,"phaseId":4,"postId":57788,"postCreationTime":1264625261,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57538,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306d22"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19845,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: A Challenge for Reusing Multiplayer Online Games without Modifying Binaries","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"A Challenge for Reusing Multiplayer Online Games without Modifying Binaries"},{"postUserId":1950,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Interesting thought - one not mentioned in the article. A bit of an explanation: I beleive the intent is to take a server persistent world and remove the server from the equation. The server portion would run on all connected clients (Peerbooster would pass messages among all clients, updating the server portion on the client) instead of on a centralized server dedicated to the game. When a new client connects, they connect to the persistent world running on all the client machines connected. I'm not sure they could play the game on their local machine with cheats before connecting to the persistent world. As an example, suppose that 500 players are playing. Player 501 joins as a new player. They would start as a 'rookie' since they are new - the other 500 servers running don't know they exist. This players information would be sent to the other 500 servers and updated as the player progresses through the game. This player could not join as an experienced player since a new player must start from the beginning. Every time they sign on the game world state must be obtained from other servers in the persistent world. If they sign off then try to play the game on their local machine using cheats to build up their character, when they sign on to the persistent world the copy of their player on their machine would be different from what every other server thinks it should be. I beleive this would preclude this type of cheat. Having said that, the paper does not mention this type of security concern, so yes, I would agree that it should be tested to ensure a player could not cheat that way.","courseId":196,"phaseId":4,"postId":57789,"postCreationTime":1264627315,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57788,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306d25"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19845,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: A Challenge for Reusing Multiplayer Online Games without Modifying Binaries","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"A Challenge for Reusing Multiplayer Online Games without Modifying Binaries"},{"postUserId":5731,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Good presentation David!

Clustering does not really apply either. An example. Suppose you and I are playing Quake 2 using PeerBooster. Your PC would have the actual game (the client) and the server binaries running. I'd have the exact same set up, I'd have the game and server binaries running as well. When you do some sort of action in the game that action updates the 'world' your server binaries are running. PeerBooster takes the action you performed and passes it to the version of the server binaries running on my machine, My 'world' updates so we are in synch. If you or I disconnect for some reason then when we connect again we get the game state from the running world. The only way that something could cause issues with the world is if we both shut down our PC's, and there were no other players playing.

Is this a generalization? I would argue that, it is government specifications (specifically compliance to strict methods of RE) that limit the use of spiral models in larger projects, NOT the requirements of the projects themselves.  3- Also in the RGM slide, where you defined the three main phases, I got confused, because you defined the requirement generation as a set of 3 phases, then you end up with the development \"processes\". there are two issues here: First, Agile methodologies adhere more to the spiral model - correct me if I am wrong -. Therefore, it can accomodate requirement  changes much more dynamically than the traditional methods of software development - where the concept of \"phase\" can apply. The RE model presented here is graphically closer to the waterfall model Second, the development is defind as \"a set of processes\", while requirement engineering is defined in the diagram as a set of three phases, yet they are mixed with each other...how can this be? 4- Whom in the industry received the framework well? 5- I agree with your conclusion, that the framwork did not provide a true consolidation between Agile and structure approaches.

Also, I don't think Zachman is an Agile framework. 2. I don't recall me saying the spiral model is not suitable for the development of larger system (correct me if I am wrong). I just don't think the proposed approach can apply Agile methodology to larger system development because the whole development process is still waterfall. 3. First, RGM is a conventional approach by itself. The authors of this paper chose it and modified it to be an Agile approach, then they call it Agile RGM. There are multiple requirements model mentioned in the paper: conventional RE, Agile RE, RGM and Agile RGM. The 1 and 2 are conventional approach. The last one is the one that the authors propose to use. Regarding your question for the \"processes\" and \"phases\", I guess the whole development process can be defined by a set of sub-process or phases, one of which is RE. The RE can have sub-phase by itself. 4. The authors say \"This work was presented at Capital One, Richmond, Virginia and was well received\" and that's all. I found it was not convincing either.

The original Zachman framework represents a highly structured one. However, there are some papers that suggest modifying it to meet Agile requirements. As for non suitability of the spiral approach to large projects, I guess that was my understanding in your talk in the \"Framework slide\" and it was repeated again later on. From a customer point of view, many large projects are required to be developed also as rapid as possible, and in such projects change during the later stages of the project should be accomodated. In such large scale projects, the waterfalll approach will not be suitable.  As for the third question, well then things are much clearer now. I haven't researched deep into this. Thanks for the clarifications. As for processes and phases...I feel that when we define project as a sequence of phases, then we are adhering more to the waterfall approach. Thus, such an approach will not allow us to accomodate for returning back to the the requirements gathering processes. As you have said, the authors failed to convince the audience that the their framework had truely gained approval from the industry. As you have clearly said, the paper presents an idea for a framework with many \"empty spaces\" to be investigated and clarified by the authors through further research.","courseId":172,"phaseId":3,"postId":49408,"postCreationTime":1243070098,"courseCategoryId":15,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Spring\/09 Archive","postParentId":49398,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306572"},"forumId":1016,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":17371,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 S09","postTitle":"Re: A Soft-Structured Agile Framework for Larger Scale Systems Development","courseCategoryName":"Grad Spring\/09 Archives","topicName":"A Soft-Structured Agile Framework for Larger Scale Systems Development"},{"postUserId":4633,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Mohmmed, You are right that there are many research suggesting the modification of Zachment framework to an Agile-like approach. Personally, I am not a fan of Zachment. Yes, it is a highly structured framework, which means it is lack of flexibility. Sorry for the confusion about the suitability of spiral approach. In my presentation, I don't think I mean to say spiral approach. In the 'Framework slide', the point from the authors that I try to say is that waterfall-like approach may not suitable for small scale system, so a SCRUM-like approach is provided and for large system, a waterfall-like approach is provided. The combination is the proposed approach from authors called \"soft-structured\". Here is what I am thinking regarding the waterfall approach. The classic waterfall absolutely does not accommodate any requirement change in later of the larger development. But its practice is necessary for large system development, for example, documentation, design before implementation. So I think introduction of iteration into the sequential software development process (waterfall) will make a restructured approach to accommodate changes. What do you think?

Authors of this paper define a small project as a project that can be done in or less than a year and large project as a project that takes more than one year in development cycle. 2. Good questions regarding the cohesive tasks and collaboration! Authors do not specify anything about it. I think this is more like a general question to Agile methodology. Since it uses people centric control instead of process centric control, without a review process scheduled during each iteration, it is very hard to guarantee that. Agile methodology relies heavily on people and requires developer to be competent and above average level [1]. Agile methodology usually provides only the principles and philosophies. As long as you can keep the agility during the whole development process. Either of collaboration between teammates or a group of integrator should be fine. In reality, origanization usually adopt one of existing Agile methodologies (SCRUM, XP, Crystal, etc..) and modifies it to a restructured approach to match their own required process.

Authors of this paper do not touch anything about project management and Agile methodology. But I think this will be a very good topic to research. I believe the traditional project management need to be adjusted to match an agile system. For example, in SCRUM, it defines iteration as sprint, which is a new way to define project schedule. Traditional project schedule is linear [1] and Agile PM has more iterations. For scope management, I would think these two approach are almost the same. Schedule management will be very different. It is hard to say which one is better. Pure agile apporach may be more difficult to manange and control because it relies heavily on people instead of process. From cost perspective, initial cost for pure Agile will be cheaper for sure because it does not generate enought documentation, but from maintenance perspective, it's hard to say. What do you think?

I'm curious about the concept of story development coming after feature development. Story development seems to correspond to the traditional concept of use cases, which are usually completed first. The risk of doing it the other way around is that the stakeholders may not know what features are actually required, because these may need to be driven out through use cases. Did the authors investigate this possibility, or did they just fix it by looping back to feature development? Concurrency of process during development is going to be important in large projects. Did the authors determine that there were any elements of the process that could not be completed concurrently, or does the Agile Framework support this everywhere? This hybrid approach the authors propose is an interesting idea. My suggestion for future research is similar to yours - I would suggest testing hypothetical models that adjust the balance of both types of process, XP and waterfall, to see if there might be an optimal balance of Agile and traditional methods that is most suited to projects of different complexity (for example, \"more waterfall\" might be better for a small system, \"more agile\" for larger ones).

I agree with you that the story development is very similar to use case development. I believe 'story' is a term created in XP to do use case. The reason to have a different name is to emphasize that the story may not be documented completely, but use cases usually do. In Agile practice, project team define high level abstraction of requirement as features. If something are discovered during story development, looping back or adding it later are always allowed because Agile RE is always a incremental and iterative development. Authors think story development, task identification and task implementation can be conducted concurrently. Personally, I cannot see any reasons that other processes cannot be conducted simultaneously. I agree with your idea for future research. You can find more details in my reply to Julio.

The concepts of forward and reverse engineering in this paper are semantically similar to forward- and backward-looking models, but not quite the same (the target is different). Forward and backward-looking models tell us about the models themselves; if you recall, this concept actually tells us why the model was created (either to describe, or to predict). In the Bezevin et al paper, these forward and reverse engineering concepts relate to the system under development, not the model. So, a forward engineering exercise, which begins with what they call an initial model, is only forward in the sense that it's following the traditional development process. Forward engineering will actually use both backward-looking and forward-looking models as the modelled system evolves, just like any other traditional development path (I have to be careful here, because this isn't necessaruly true of something like a spiral development cycle). Reverse engineering is the same - it's only reverse in the context of the system being developed. It also starts with this initial model according to Bezevin, which is functionally equivalent to a backward-looking model because it's modelling a real entity. The key difference is exactly what this initial model is describing - it's always a backward-looking model, but in forward engineering it's modelling a set of use cases, and in reverse engineering it's modelling a running system.

As soon as the system is complete, and this new system is a model of the original problem, it's a representation of those business processes that the engineers originally modeled. In other words, it's a backward-looking model of those original concepts (paper processes, legacy systems, whatever they happened to be). Now, the comments I made in response to Tony's question should probably be explained. If you have a spiral development process, each time you go around the life cycle and develop a new prototype, you go through the full cycle: you start with backward-looking models of the issue to be addressed, then forward-looking models of the solution, and finally the prototype as a backward-looking model of the original problem. At the same time, though, that prototype can also be a forward-looking model to predict the next prototype or deliverable. This is much like the concepts of descriptive and prescriptive models in the paper you referred to (another good one, thanks). The semantics are slightly different, but a descriptive model is basically a backward-looking one, while a prescriptive model is forward-looking, describing something that doesn't exist yet. That paper is an interesting view of modeling, and the author actually has a good discussion of this concept of the shift between backward- and forward-looking models in the middle of a project (although he calls them descriptive and prescriptive, and focuses mostly on the latter). This paper predates the one I reviewed, so it's possible Gonzalez-Perez and Henderson-Sellers (or some other researchers, the origin of the terms wasn't clear) have developed the other terminology after this paper was written.

I was under the impression it was not just for software engineering but simply modelling. It's not that I don't think abstracting and generalizing is a bad thing. But from my days in Elec. Eng. modelling tools were very different from software modelling because we were modelling things like electrical and magnetic fields, semi conductor equations, circuit logic gates...as oppose to higher level, often object-oriented based, computer applications. It seems to me, and this I admit is with little comtemplation, that trying to develop something 'too' universal would complicate things a little as oppose to have modelling languages domain specific (elec. eng., software eng., mech. eng, maths...each having their own modelling methods and tools).

The authors' discussion of models and methodologies is truly universal - they intend it to apply to much more than the software engineering discipline. I didn't spend a whole lot of time on it in the presentation, but they do claim their ideas canspan domains in this way. In the section on Modelling Languages, they discuss how to build a modelling language from scratch. It starts with \"kinds\" of model units, built up to create kinds of models and modelling languages. So in theory, as long as you begin with the appropriate concepts, the right entities and relationships, you can create an appropriate modelling language to model anything (they mention an architectonic model made up of model unit kinds called Wall, Room and Door). This is really the focus of the paper, this idea that the theory and the methodology has to be correct. The example about the Book class that they used to demonstrate some of the problems with UML is a good example of this - the reason they don't like UML, and presumably one of the reasons OMG's products can't be adapted to other domains, is because it makes these kinds of assumptions about which domain you're working in. It also helps that they don't promote any actual tools - they're talking just about the theory. That always makes it easier to claim it can do anything. ---Chris","courseId":172,"phaseId":2,"postId":49869,"postCreationTime":1244161244,"courseCategoryId":15,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Spring\/09 Archive","postParentId":49857,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306614"},"forumId":1016,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":17502,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 S09","postTitle":"Re: Modelling software development methodologies: A conceptual foundation","courseCategoryName":"Grad Spring\/09 Archives","topicName":"Modelling software development methodologies: A conceptual foundation"},{"postUserId":3921,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Chris, Your presentation was well organized!

You've posed some excellent questions. The developers didn't really do a study of the kinds of problems developers encounter with modeling approaches. They did identify some of the issues with UML, and the other products the Object Management Group makes available, but the focus was very much on the problems they see in the OMG's modeling approach. So for example, this issue with mappings between modeling layers was really an issue for them. If you imagine that the translation between the initial model and the object in the running system relies on a mental trick to accomplish the correct result, it introduces the possibility that another observer can interpret the model in a different way. As another example, if the difference between modeling a relationship between two key system objects as another object or as a relationship (refer back to the discussion on nodes and arcs) is the developer's opinion, rather than a solid framework that defines a consistent approach, there is randomness in the system. More importantly, if these translations are subjective, it becomes impossible to translate from the model to final code using an automated system. This is one of the promised benefits of Model Driven Architecture, this idea of automated code generation from the model. If the model can be interpreted in different ways, it becomes impossible to consistently reach the same results. In my opinion, this would be the biggest benefit of a modeling process that resolved the issues the authors raised - it would bring us one step further to solving one of the traditional \"hard\" problems of modeling, trying to translate from model to code (and back, preferably) in an automated way. ---Chris","courseId":172,"phaseId":3,"postId":49875,"postCreationTime":1244172093,"courseCategoryId":15,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Spring\/09 Archive","postParentId":49870,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306617"},"forumId":1016,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":17502,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 S09","postTitle":"Re: Modelling software development methodologies: A conceptual foundation","courseCategoryName":"Grad Spring\/09 Archives","topicName":"Modelling software development methodologies: A conceptual foundation"},{"postUserId":4633,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Chris, Nice presentation and interesting topic. The authors are trying to replace UML with a new model language. Why is necessary? Everything has good or bad. As we all know, UML is not perfect and it's still evolving. UML has been used widely and proved to be useful in many situations. Is there any reason from author that UML cannot be modified to satisfy the interpretive mapping?  The model with nodes and arcs are more like ER model used in the database design. But i am not sure that such concept can be also used to replace UML. Architecture are capture more information than just entity and relaion, such as sequence, dependency and protocol. I cannot see the new model can record those information. As authors say, a methodology include a procedure and related tools. Do authors mention any tool that use can use? Authors recommend to create meta-model to describe model itself. Personally, I don't agree with the direction. I think, to describe the architecture for a software system, the simpler and clearer, the better. The more complexity being introduced to the modeling itself, the more chance for the whole project to fail. The reason is that complex and sophisticated models are difficult for people to understand.

I agree, it seems at times as if the authors are fighting a battle that only they see as necessary. Their argument against UML is a foundational one, though - they're arguing not so much against specific UML features, but against the methodology used to create UML. In other words, it's not that UML is broken, it's that the way it was created could not possibly result in a proper modeling language. From the standpoint of pure theory, the authors are correct - there's nothing wrong with their logic. What they're missing, though, is that formal frameworks sometimes have to be violated, or the rules bent, for efficiency. To extend the example you gave of database design, we all know that sometimes we intentionally break normalization rules for efficiency. My opinion of UML is that the issues the authors have with it are in that category - they might be technically true, but not in ways that actually matter. Of course, they could be absolutely correct, and UML is wrong and must be replaced with something better. The problem is that unless and until they can use their theories to develop a new methology, complete with modeling language and framework, and show how it's better than UML in the real world, I think they'll continue to get some skepticism. As you say, they don't show us any tools, which is to be expected since they're only dealing with background theory. But until those tools exist, it's \"true but irrelevant\". Note that that's just my opinion... the authors are very well-respected in their field, have authored a large number of peer-reviewed papers, and I'm comfortable assuming they know what they're talking about.

As you say, the authors take issue with the entire suite of OMG's products. It's worth pointing out that OMG isn't responsible for creating these, though - the UML and the other products were developed by peer groups and evolved through collaboration and consensus, much like the ITIL standards for service management. UML was not the only submission, there were several others that were proposed. I would be interested to see which of the competing submissions the authors of this paper supported. Although UML was eventually chosen, if there were intentional choices made for reasons of efficiency rather than theoretical correctness, it's not hard to imagine that some would disagree. As you suggest, though, the wide acceptance of UML is certainly one of the key factors. On the other hand, OMG's products are the result of ongoing collaboration, and the progression through major and minor versions of UML shows how it has evolved. I don't doubt that, if the issues the authors raised are seen as significant. the UML can adapt to correct them. I like the suggestion for future research.

If I think about modelling in non-software fields, the modelling effort, in designing a car for example, is usually meant to predict what the new car will look like, how it will perform and so on, whereas a model of an existing car, say of a Ford Model T, captures those properties of the previously existing entity. Therefore, the design model is forward-looking and the model is backward-looking. If I use the same analogy, then in software development the efforts of building new software is forward-looking modelling and the end product, the software, is a backward-looking model. I think that is what Tong was saying as well. In that regard, prototypes would still be forward-looking models because they are used to refine the predicted properties of the yet-to-be-completed software and do not model a previously existing entity. Do you agree?

Yes, I think that fits with the authors' discussions. It really depends on perspective, though. As a couple of you have pointed out, it's entirely possible for a specific model to be both backward-looking and forward-looking. This really goes to what the authors say about these models, though: the key is not the specifics of the model, or what it's built with, it's how it will be used. The \"how\" and \"why\" of the model, rather than the \"what\", determine whether it reflects reality or predicts something new. ---Chris","courseId":172,"phaseId":2,"postId":50024,"postCreationTime":1244680524,"courseCategoryId":15,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Spring\/09 Archive","postParentId":49906,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d3065ed"},"forumId":1016,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":17502,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 S09","postTitle":"Re: Modelling software development methodologies: A conceptual foundation","courseCategoryName":"Grad Spring\/09 Archives","topicName":"Modelling software development methodologies: A conceptual foundation"},{"postUserId":5733,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Chris, A very well done presentation.

The authors' paper is strictly theoretical, but it seems to be part of a progression. In other words, they've submitted several other papers, some of which they referred to in this one, and they intend to extend on this one in future papers. I would expect them to further develop these concepts to produce some real-world applicable research. For some more examples of the interpretive mappings, consider a city map. Each major street shown in the map is an isotypical mapping - it exists only once in the real world for each street shown on the map. The indicators on the map showing hospitals, libraries, and so on are metatypical - they're descriptive, the label specifies the characteristics of that entity. Prototypical mappings are a bit more difficult, but consider that the map can only show a certain high level of detail - smaller streets aren't shown, which demonstrates the one-to-many relationship between the streets on the map and the streets in the real world. ---Chris","courseId":172,"phaseId":4,"postId":50025,"postCreationTime":1244681557,"courseCategoryId":15,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Spring\/09 Archive","postParentId":49914,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d30662c"},"forumId":1016,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":17502,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 S09","postTitle":"Re: Modelling software development methodologies: A conceptual foundation","courseCategoryName":"Grad Spring\/09 Archives","topicName":"Modelling software development methodologies: A conceptual foundation"},{"postUserId":3835,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Reference to the article: Erik Arisholm, Hans Gallis, Tore Dyb?, Dag I.K.

You obviously took time to prepare each slide and spent time understanding the article when preparing your presentation. However, as nice as the graphics are, I was expecting some points to be referenced as text.  This technique allows the user to pause the video and consider the information on the screen, something you can't really do with a one-word caption beside a graphic, as nice as it looks. I would agree with the authors conclusion that pair programming does not necessarily equate to a decrease in task duration.  It seems a bit obvious that you don't need two programmers to work on easy tasks -- the purpose of pair programming being to have one person monitor the other persons work, and vice versa.  I find in my own development work that sometimes having someone to just bounce ideas off of, gets the creative juices flowing.  A non-relevant comment from another developer can be enough to get me back on track again.  So the concept of pair programming in the described forms may or may not be effective, however two heads are always better than one.... I also wonder if the authors of this study properly considered the types of groups to be included in the study.  Perhaps combinations of junior and intermediate, and intermediate-senior pairings would have resulted in a different outcome.  Or at least a better understanding of how pair programming can be used effectively on a project.

One observation I had was that a junior programmer was paired with another junior programmer and so on. I believe that goes against the traditional method of knowledge transfer. I believe that if a junior was paired with an intermediate or a senior then there would be knowledge transfer from the intermediate or senior to the junior.

Cute clip arts!! I agree with the authors' statement that paired programming benefits junior programmers. I would like to point out that paired programming could also help a new developer that entered an organization, who needs to ramp up and gain a deeper understanding on how an organization's product offering works, i.e. how it is supposed to be maintained, and the internals of the system that is to be built upon or maintained. This can be achieved by letting the new developer pair-program with a developer who has been working with the company for some time. I totally agree that paired programming must be applied across different levels of developers, i.e. a junior developer doing paired programming with a senior developer, and so on and so forth.

They did not compare european versus american developers, but they DID recognize that since they were only looking at EU developers there could be bias introduced due to cultural differences. I agree this would be an excellent area to look into. I was actually reading an article about the differences in what programmer and IT people look for in the US versus India and due to cultural difference it is completely different. In the US often there is more prestige associated with being part of a start-up, where in India it's more prestigious to be part of a large and stable company like IBM. So i think this is an excellent area to look into and agree it could have introduced bias. Your last point -- you know the paper said that in the experiment they required PP's to switch from driver to navigator, if even only for 5 minutes. But they did not explain WHY.

However juniors are on a lower pay scale, and if you can ensure that the final product is solved quicker (duration) and more correct (correctness) then the overhead of two juniors might be covered, this would be the selling feature.

I really enjoyed watching your presentation and it definitely wasn't overwhelmed with text! My only criticisms (and they are minor) might be you spoke a little fast and If I wanted to follow up a bit more the slides wouldn't provide me with the general overview without your audio. I found this to be a very interesting and relevant topic personally. I have found the dynamics between programmers intriguing, interesting and oftentimes hilarious. 1. My assumption has always been that the better the programmer the more they tended to be logical, analytical, ambitious, self-confident and by association with these other traits a tad aloof. I have had several programmers work for me and found by observation the better the programmer the more they tended to prefer working in isolation - even to the point of emailing their colleagues who are sitting right next to them! Were the factors of personality traits considered as part of the dynamic between pair programmers?

I also found it interesting that the researchers did mention other factors such as country, culture etc. But something also came to mind that I wondered as well. Was the idea of gender considered in their research? Without wanting to offend anyone males (of the species) have a tendency to be more isolated and insular and this appears to get even more exaggerated when it comes to the maths and sciences (everyone please beat me up over this). My original thought was women would probably perform better and be more collaborative in a pair programming environment. Would this be your thinking as well?

I'm a woman working in a very large well known IT company that is world wide. For Canada i'm the most senior technical woman for the company and in the top 5 of the technical resources for the entire company. I'm always interested in gender studies and pay attention when the obligatory articles come out about \"why there are mot more women in engineering and computer science\". I also read with scorn the ridiculous hypotheses laid out such as women don't feel comfortable in a largely male dominated field, etc. I think it's all garbage. I can tell you that I've been in school (electronic engineering, computer science) where I've often been the only woman. I work on projects and go to conferences and lead programming teams where 90% of the technical resources are men. And i have NEVER felt it was EVER an issue. In fact I have probably gotten more opportunities and perks because I am a minority in this field. I have never encountered any derogatory or detrimental due to my gender. I chalk this up to the fact that I have never viewed my life or career in terms of gender, I've always considered myself just one of everyone else and thus I have never made it an issue, and when you don't make it an issue no one else does. I remember sitting in a boardroom during a requirements engineering session and the client's female PM made some comment to me about us two being the only women in the room. And I thought, wow, I would have never even noticed that unless she pointed it out, and even then I did not care. Obviously she did, and might be one of the people who feel intimidated by male dominant fields. I bring this all up because I don't buy the notion that women due to their \"nurturing\" and \"social\" behavioral traits would work better in teams. I'd be actually interested in doing more study into this, but after many years of experiencing and thinking about it, my opinion is this. People who go into math and science, engineering, computer science are of a certain mind-set. Whether this be nature or nurture or combination (I believe it to be more nature\/genetic) there are people out there with certain traits that make them gravitate and do well in these fields. I have read several studies that claim that a good portion of these people may site somewhere on the mild end of the autistic spectrum. I believe that these traits, common among those who are attracted to these fields occur more commonly in men. I don't know why, maybe science will explain it one day. Thus you see the skewed gender representation in these fields. What this means is that a lot these people have the traits you describe above REGARDLESS of gender. I can tell you from personal experience, all my female friends who are goods programmers are similar to me in many traits, we all generally score the same on Myers - Briggs like personality tests, and these traits are NOT ones generally associated with women. We are generally highly analytical, not at all emotional, etc. So in my opinion that puts a hole in your theory. That said, there are technical women who do exhibit the traits of working together you talk about, but in my experience they usually leave the the hard core analytical jobs by the intermediate phase and move into the more social aspect jobs such as project management. At least they do in my company. So that's my 2 cents. You can see this is of great interest to me and I'm definitely going to read those papers you posted.","courseId":196,"phaseId":3,"postId":57533,"postCreationTime":1264257636,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57493,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d304153"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19879,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Evaluating Pair Programming with Respect to System Complexity and Programmer Expertise","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Evaluating Pair Programming with Respect to System Complexity and Programmer Expertise"},{"postUserId":1963,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi, The presetation was \"Awesome\".

That this study only looked at correctness, duration and effort in homogeneous teams indeed leaves out an important aspect of PP, so important that everyone in this discussion immediately sees the intrinsic value of it - knowledge transfer. That said there can only be so many variables in a study and the authors of the study acknowledge right away that they expressly did not consider knowledge transfer an that in critically evaluating the value of PP this is important but was not considered. I personally see value in it. However, there are also down sides. I know in my organization I mentor several people\/developers, but that is only 10% of my time, the other 90% is that of a billable senior resource demanding the highest bill out rate for the company. Imagine if that was swapped with me being 90% of my time sitting beside a junior, this would be a massive loss of revenue for the company. So is the central goal of the business to teach and train inside resources or is it to build software systems? Obviously we get paid for doing the latter, so in my case I think the Senior \/ Junior team as being a loosing proposition and there are better ways to handle mentoring and knowledge transfer. 2- unfortunately there was literally one line in the author's paper saying that because EU programmer were considered there could be cultural bias introduced. And that was it. I think what they were trying to get at is that different cultures (and since the study considered UK and Nordic countries there could be biases BETWEEN these cultures) view working with others and teamwork in different ways. This is introduced to you at a very young age via the culture you are brought up in. Different cultures view the value of the individual versus the value of the group very differently and thus the ability of the subjects to start working in a paired environment with someone they haven't worked with before may be biased by their culture. I would suspect that cultures that emphasize the group over the individual would be more comfortable with their partner and team work setting immediately whereas those that value the individual would not. I suspect if this study was done in North America there would be different results.","courseId":196,"phaseId":3,"postId":57534,"postCreationTime":1264258404,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57515,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306cb1"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19879,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Evaluating Pair Programming with Respect to System Complexity and Programmer Expertise","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Evaluating Pair Programming with Respect to System Complexity and Programmer Expertise"},{"postUserId":5098,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Wow - a lot of great discussion!

How Pair Programming Really Works Wray, Stuart; Software, IEEE Volume 27,  Issue 1,  Jan.-Feb. 2010 Page(s):50 - 55 Digital Object Identifier 10.1109\/MS.2009.199 In the above paper the idea that PP is usually manifested as one programmer in the role of \"driver\" and the other as \"navigator\" is challenged.

I do agree that for a heterogeneous mix (senior\/junior) there is probably a lot of benefit for knowledge transfer, but I think there are better way to achieve knowledge transfer without pulling senior resources out of the billable pool so much. I think there is benefit for junior\/junior but that's pretty much it. The blog - Menlo Innovations that I referenced earlier has a lot of people posting about their personal experiences with PP and they all are extremely positive, so there is a lot of anecdotal information on the positive effects. But I, like the authors of the paper think that this needs to be held up to experimental scrutiny, because the truth of the matter is you're doubling your effort (two people) and is the benefit worth it? Especially when today's world is very competitive in terms of project work and rates, the margins have to be there to justify it. I also think there are a lot of human factors that need to be considered such as working styles and personal disposition. I can tell you that PP would probably work horribly for me for various reasons, but I'm considered a senior resource and that seems to be supported by the study. Then again on the Menlo Innovations blog, I read a really, really interesting posting by a person who works in the paired programming model. She is very talented but has suffered depression her entire life. The type of depression where it's hard to get out of bed. In her case, the fact that she was paired with someone, and basically had a responsibility to someone (they were waiting for her to get to work so they could work) gave her a reason to literally get out of bed and perform. There were also other social positive effects for her. I find these outlying cases like the one above really interesting because it's not something that a study will most likely pick up on, but I can see it not being a totally isolated case, so there's these hidden benefits we don't see and can't predict until we are exposed to various people's point of view.","courseId":196,"phaseId":4,"postId":57610,"postCreationTime":1264339490,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57574,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306cb6"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19879,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Evaluating Pair Programming with Respect to System Complexity and Programmer Expertise","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Evaluating Pair Programming with Respect to System Complexity and Programmer Expertise"},{"postUserId":4275,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Rachel, This was an excellent presentation. It is obvious that you have had experience in doing presentations before. I found the topic interesting, and look forward to doing more reading on it. I have to admit that I find the concept of paired programming to be a bit strange. However, for the juniour programmers there seemed to be a definite advantage to it. The study found that there was little benefit observed for senior programmers working in pairs on complex projects. Do you feel that this may be due to the fact that the programmers had not worked with each other in the past? Senior programmers tend (and I know I'm exaggerating here) to believe that they know everything, and everyone else on the team is a moron. If they are working with a senior that they haven't worked with, they may have spent more time ironing out differences of approaches and other sylistic issues, as well as sorting out whether or not the other person was actually knowledgeable. I would be very interested in seeing a follow up study dealing with intermediate \/ senior programmers who either are working on a longer project, or who have more experience working together.

But, in their area of expertise, they will tend to discount the opinion of other people. When your are a specialist in an area, it is *very* easy to believe that your approach has to be the correct one. The good ones will recognize this and try to look at other peoples ideas impartially, even if they believe that their own idea is the best way forward. I know I've caught myself in the past making this mistake, and almost threw away a great suggestion from a very junior person just because it didn't fit in to the preconceived idea I had for the best way forward. Fortunately the junior person was persistent, and wanted me to explain to him why his idea wouldn't work. When I stopped to explain how it wouldn't work in our environment, going into detail, I ended up realizing it would work, apologized for discounting it, and started working out the details of whether or not the idea was something we wanted to include. I was fortunate that early on in my career, when I was still in the stage where I thought I knew everything, I spent some time working with a consulting firm who had some serious experts in areas I thought I was good. It didn't take too long talking to them to realize just how much more I had to learn to consider myself an expert.

Firstly, I'd like to say it was an interesting way to present video with pictures alone. Although, I'm not sure if Kabongo would agree after reviewing his article on how tagging the video is more effective compared to plain video. With regards to pair programming, I also have to agree that the effectiveness of it really depends on the complexity of the problem. I would think when you are employing to solve a very complex problem, there's more chance of getting it solved with two persons than one. However, based on the article's conclusions, if the task is something that is not necessarily challenging, you are better off with having one person solving it. It is definitely less expensive with one person than two. Also, if I need to get moderately complex task done faster but cheaper, I would use two junior instead of two senior programmers or one of each. This study and the results are definitely something that management would be interested in knowing when hiring programmers for a given problem\/project. Another important factor I believe is how well you can work with the other person. If you don't carry out a good communication, the task would not get solved effectively. In this case, knowing the person ahead of time might be beneficial. It also depends on whether it is a long term or short term task. As you posted earlier, we wouldn't want someone to go into depression because s\/he has to work with another person every day. So, this might be good for short term but not on a daily basis at work.

I really enjoyed your presentation.  I have a comment to make on requirements engineering in general. Usage of the term \"requirements engineering\" is so prevalent that even SWEBOK mentions it, although it is to say that it should be avoided ( see the quote at the bottom of this post). I feel that since requirements handling is so often referred to as engineering that perhaps SWEBOK is wrong and requirements handling should actually be a separate engineering field.  Your presentation seems to be mostly about tying requirements handling\/engineering to a capability maturity model. This also suggests that requirements handling is an engineering discipline in itself. What are your thoughts on this? Is SWEBOK correct or is the state of the practise proving to be correct?  Cheers, Jeanne \"The term \u201Crequirements engineering\u201D is widely used in the field to denote the systematic handling of requirements. For reasons of consistency, though, this term will not be used in the Guide, as it has been decided that the use of the term \u201Cengineering\u201D for activities other than software engineering ones is to be avoided in this edition of the Guide. For the same reason, \u201Crequirements engineer,\u201D a term which appears in some of the literature, will not be used either. Instead, the term \u201Csoftware engineer\u201D or, in some specific cases, \u201Crequirements specialist\u201D will be used, the latter where the role in question is usually performed by an individual other than a software engineer.

Very informative presentation, I liked the graphs, it was well explained, I agree with your comments and those of the author(s). It does raise questions when several software projects are over budgeted and have to face failure. One will think that with all the published stats on software failure most software company will consider requirement engineering among the many first steps to take in software development but as you said the bottom line is all that matters.. My experience working with software companies were that speed was all that matters, the first steps, we send specs to the client; second step a brief and a quick discussion between the chief developer and the client. After that we start coding and we coded so more, coding after coding and this practices seem to be very common, as I programmed for different companies. I can see how software Company develops wrong software due to wrong interpretation of requirements. I believe Requirements engineering should find a soft spot in software engineering.

Just one question: You mentioned that some 'organizations have poorly defined requirements engineering processes', that is if these organizations have such a thing. I am of the opinion that a requirements engineering process is affected, and dependent on an organization's process structures, be it for development or business. For instance, Agile versus CMMI. According to many academic discussions, Agile and CMMI are like night and day. Herewith some resources: 1. http:\/\/www.sei.cmu.edu\/library\/abstracts\/reports\/08tn003.cfm 2. http:\/\/www.agilemanagement.net\/Articles\/Papers\/StretchingAgiletoFitCMMIL.html 3. http:\/\/www.agilecmmi.com\/ I also observed from my work experience that organizations that adapt agile usually have flat\/ matrix organizational structures. And organizations that adapt CMMI usually have hierarchical organizational structures (bureaucracy would be a more apt term...). More specifically, Agile's focus is on working code for a system, and CMMI's focus is on documentation for a system. I have the working experience in both these frameworks and my opinion is that CMMI hinders a developer's productivity. My question is as follows: Is there a way to perform effective requirements engineering in an agile framework, using the strengths of Requirements Engineering, as per your discussion, without hindering either the productivity of agile developers, or the effectiveness of an agile framework?

I totally agree with your comments above. Agile and CMMI are at two opposite ends of the spectrum.  And it is also hard to bring in the effective requirements engineering in an Agile framework and not without hindering a agile developers productivity. I have observed some success with using the Scrum Framework with Agile and the CMMI processes when I was employed with some of the finanical institutions. Some of the CMMI's rigidity for processing was reduced somewhat as the scrum framework was used. There were success results using this combination. Hope that helps.

The core idea of the approach is to regard the development of a set of products as a single, coherent development task. This approach has been shown to produce orders of magnitude economic improvements over one-at-a-time software system development. A software product line is a set of software-intensive systems sharing a common, managed set of features that satisfy specific needs of a particular market or mission, and that are developed from a common set of core assets in a prescribed way, according to the definition used by the Software Engineering Institute. This definition identifies the main roles in a product line organization. Core asset developers provide a range of assets, such as architectures, specifications, and implementations, to product developers for their use in producing products. Product line managers coordinate and facilitate the work of these two groups. Executives in the organization set strategic goals such as producing more products more quickly and allocate responsibility for achieving those goals. Product line operates in two circles: core-asset development and product development, core assets are software artefacts that are developed or acquired which are owned by the product line, and are available for acquisition as building blocks for specific products. It is driven by the needs of specific products, both present and future.

Value-Based Software Engineering is more or less an approach or methodology on how to approach the software\\systems development life cycle and not necessarily concerned with software products already developed (such as with the product life cycle - Development, Introduction, Growth, Maturity, Decline). A fully developed product that has been delivered to the client will at this point either be considered a successful, challenged or impaired project [Standish Group - CHOAS report 1994]. Instilling VBSE into the software development process is meant to ensure that once a project is delivered to a client, that it is a success and that the challenges or impairment factors are minimized. VBSE as a software engineering process would not address value considerations when a project has already been developed. As those value considerations are what is needed for a project to get delivered to a client successfully. Given what I said above, Boehm does touch on one thing that might relate to value considerations for already fully developed products through his concept of \"software as an investment.\" Software must be seen as an investment and with any investment it must create some sort of tangible or intangible value and benefit (otherwise why would it ever be created?). For already developed products, VBSE would need to consistently reassess the benefit of an already developed product and determine its benefits and its costs. For example: At my company we have a web application called TimeTracker which employees use this to enter their time spent on tasks with respect to a particular project for billing purposes and metrics. We recently decided to upgrade and redo our web application. Why? The existing application met our need of acquiring data for project related tasks and resources, however it was very unusable i.e. we had drop downs with hundreds of entries (took forever to find your project), it couldn't memorize old entries etc... people were taking too long filling out their time sheets. As such a proposal was made to create a new one. Value being generated from the time people saved with the new system minus cost of implementing the solution\/Oportunity cost was greater than the value being generated from the previous system. As such, such an investment in software should be undertaken. Another example of software as an investment can seen through issues such as having to choose to modify existing module or to do one from scratch.","courseId":143,"phaseId":4,"postId":41710,"postCreationTime":1221930449,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":41552,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d305f60"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":14941,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda"},{"postUserId":1309,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Laurie, Thanks for the good question. The whole premise of VBSE is that at the end of the day, you are delivering a software product that is \"valuable\" to the client\/business etc... As such, the notion of that particular \"value\" of the client\/business needs to be ingrained through out every task that is undertaken through the SDLC. Given that Project Management is defined as being: \"the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements,\" [PMBOK 2004] there are definately areas whereby VBSE can be applied to instill value considerations with respect to the triple constraint (Time, Cost, Scope). There is never a perfect project so there will always be issues in managing the triple constraint and the tradeoffs that must be made. Boehm would believe that there is no correct way of making trade offs between time, cost and scope in the Value-Based approach. As the interpretation of \"value\" has subjective connotations that is, time, cost and scope considerations are should be be based on a stakeholder's utility function (and if you want to take this a step further, their indifference curve). Boehm would argue that as a PM it is not your job to to make that decision but rather include and incorporate your stakeholders into the decision making process to ensure that whatever decision is made in the context of time, cost and scope, their value propositions are being reflected and considered. For example (from the project im currently overseeing): Our Project is currently in status yellow. We are currently in the SIT (System Integration Testing phase) yet we are still have issues with the testing of our connectivity with some of our third party partners. Our process specifies that we cannot leave our SIT phase and move into UAT (User Acceptance Testing) until these connectivity issues are resolved. We are currently two weeks behind in our SIT testing and we are accumulating a huge burn rate (we have outsourced QA for this project and we cannot untilize them because they cannot run test cases against these thirs party partners). We have been told that we need to have this product delivered by Oct 24th and we have almost used up all of our contigency for this project already. In this case, we proposed various options to ensure that our project is still a success: 1. Simply extend the project time line to account for these difficulties occuring during SIT. 2. Ensure that only configuration and testing of our most widely used partners is working. (Essentially decreasing QA scope) 3. Move into UAT anyway and begin doing functional test cases until we resolve the connectivity issues (cost issue\/risk issue). All of these options are valid. But which one is the right one? It all depends on what the stakeholders want and believe to be the most \"valuable\" option. In our case, our stakeholders despite giving us a date of Oct 24th to complete the project felt that their interests were better served by going straight into UAT. Why? our stakeholders did not have the resources and\/or bandwidth to support any kind of QA activity past the 24th (hence the outsourcing). There is still a real risk that issues with connectivity would never be resolved or tested, it was still extremely valuable to have QA testing as we could no longer use them past the 24th if the project got pushed back. So to sum everything up, the VBSE approach to managing the trade offs of the triple constraint of Project Management is to ensure that decisions that are taken (time, cost , scope) should always be reflective to the value proposition of the stakeholders (what to do when value considerations come into conflict is another topic in itself :) ).","courseId":143,"phaseId":4,"postId":41708,"postCreationTime":1221927517,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":41519,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d301d3d"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":14941,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda"},{"postUserId":1325,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Christian.

Essentially Boehm pulled data from an experience report for an organization that categorized customers based on their billing type (no much else is said on that), however the association of customer type to business \"value\" was based on how that billing type led to increase billing revenue from greater satisfaction\/retention and decreased cost from lower customer complaints. So to answer your question directly, Boehm states that the determination of \"value\" in the ATG example is the result of how each customer relates to revenue through sales, the retention of those individuals, and lastly the decrease in costs through customer compliants etc... One thing to take note of here, is that the term \"value\" does not need to be be in monetary form i.e. sales. Value is an arbitrary term that can mean the number of smiles on the face of your stakeholder for example... Measuring value is a very difficult task, and the only way to determine \"value\" is to determine what is the value proposition of software to its stakeholder. In your example you state \"is it purely a question of \"sales\" or is there another measure of value (as not all software is sold).\" Value is whatever your stakeholder says it to be. In the ATG example, value was how to achieve the best ROI. However, if value was to meet a SLA with a client who needs to have all the client types tested, then not doing the Pareto testing would be the proper course of action.","courseId":143,"phaseId":2,"postId":41715,"postCreationTime":1221935252,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":41572,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d305f54"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":14941,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda"},{"postUserId":1309,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"ITS FIXED :) https:\/\/triton2.athabascau.ca\/vshare\/view\/49\/value-based-software-engineering-v2\/","courseId":143,"phaseId":0,"postId":41590,"postCreationTime":1221688650,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":41433,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d303f49"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":14941,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda"},{"postUserId":3191,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Christian!

Thanks for the compliment. The paper was actually a poor choice for TME1 as it discussed a great deal of breadth with not much depth. It touched on a lot of different topics and ideas that was difficult to do in a 20 min presentation (my initial presentation was 40 mins long lol). As for your questions here are they answers: 1. Earned-Value is very similar in concept to VBSE. The key difference between the two is scope of value assessment. Earned-value is defined as being a project management process that contains: A project plan that identifies the work to be accomplished A valuation of planned work (PV) A predefined \"Earning Rules\" to quantify the accomplishment of work called Earned-Value. [wikipedia] As such, the intact process for determining value is based on monitoring the project plan, analyzing the actual work being completed and its \"value\" to see if the project is on track. This approach does not mean that at the end of the project that you have actually built something that the customer really wants or expected... For example how would \"incomplete requirements\" a project failure factor be tracked through earned-value? If upon initial analysis you begin accomplishing certain deliverables or tasks there would be noway to know at this point that something was missed or that \"value\" is missing. VBSE on the other hand takes a more holistic approach to ensuring that value is achieved by ensuring that \"Value\" is something that is done through every activity of the software development lifecycle. That there is always some sort of activity that relates back to your stakeholder's value proposition. 2. Boehm's claim that at present current software engineering projects are not successful (successful does not mean that they were not profitable. They just did not go according to plan i.e. modification of time lines, scope, and cost) was based off of the Standish group's CHOAS report (http:\/\/net.educause.edu\/ir\/library\/pdf\/NCP08083B.pdf). Without going into the report too deeply, the CHOAS report states that: Cost Overruns % of Responses Under 20% 15.5% 21 - 50% 31.5% 51 - 100% 29.6% 101 - 200% 10.2% 201 - 400% 8.8% Over 400% 4.4% Time Overruns % of Responses Under 20% 13.9% 21 - 50% 18.3% 51 - 100% 20.0% 101 - 200% 35.5% 201 - 400% 11.2% Over 400% 1.1% % of Features\/Functions % of Responses Less Than 25% 4.6% 25 - 49% 27.2% 50 - 74% 21.8% 75 - 99% 39.1% 100% 7.3% Given that most projects are judged by the following three criteria's time, cost, scope (and quality). The fact that any of these metrics are never been met is a cause of concern. With respect to your question on the criteria for measuring success, the Standish Group basically took a survey and asked different organization's what were project success factors i.e. user involvement, project challenge factors (modified time, scope, cost but project still delivered), and project impairment factors (what cancelled a project). It was through these metrics or factors that Boehm based his assessment of the state of software development projects.","courseId":143,"phaseId":2,"postId":41719,"postCreationTime":1221936857,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":41592,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d303492"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":14941,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda"},{"postUserId":4629,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Christian, I was impressed by the fact that you manage to understand and present so many concepts.

The paper really did have a lot of different concepts and it was hard to present them effectively. I was definitely short on time presenting my material, so I'm glad you were able to understand its content as I spoke and presented pretty quickly :) So just to make sure I understand your question, you want to know whether or not there is any \"risk\" involved in taking a value-based approach to software engineering? If that's the case, then here is my answer: Boehm does not discuss the risks involved in Value-Based Software Engineering but seems to imply that the only way to resolve the project failure rates that are tracked by the Standish Group, is to begin by taking and understanding value in the context of stakeholders and ensure that every activity that is undertaken such as analysis, testing, programming, managing can all see how their efforts translate into stakeholder value. For this perspective he seems to imply that you cannot take the risk ignoring value considerations within the software development lifecycle. Is Value-Based Software Engineering risky in my opinion? I would agree so at this time. There currently arent any kind of mature and proven value-based software engineering tools of any kind that has been proven to be effective. Furthermore, there is still very little in terms of a core knowldege base or competency in the field (there is only one book written on the subject). However, despite the \"newness\" of the field, it is still vitally important to begin thinking of proper ways of instilling value within the SDLC. The point of Boehm's work was to present the case of VBSE and direct its future directions :) A little side note: Just on the topic of Risk, Boehm wrote another paper titled: \"Value-Based Software Engineering: Seven Key Elements and Ethical Considerations\" whereby he mentions how risk is often something that is never considered of any value within the softeware development lifecycle. However, using risk can be very beneficial as illustrated in this example: Consider a programmer who is given 4 weeks to complete a developmemt project. The developer notices he has two choices to complete the work. 1) Develop a new version of the module which will take 4 weeks 2) Attempt to refactor current functionality which has an 80% chance of completion in 1 week but a 20% chance of completion in 6 weeks. If we take the expected value of option 2, the expected completion date would be 2 weeks. Boehm argues that given a stakeholder's utility function and how risk-adverse they are, that incorporating such risk can be seen as a very valuable venture as on average, the developer would complete the work in 2 weeks as oppossed to 4.

As for you questions: 1. Is this a new concept, or maybe not widely used - and if so any ideas why? Value-Based Software Engineering is a relatively new concept (2005), it was born out of a research group called EDSER (Economic Driven Software Engineering Research) that has been around since 1998 (http:\/\/www.cs.virginia.edu\/~sullivan\/EDSER-8\/). A lot of papers within this research group touched on the topic of \"value\" within software engineering however, it wasn't until Boehm in his paper (Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda) that he attempts clarify exactly what Value-Based Software Engineering is, and attempts to formalize a basis for its foundation. As to why this field hasn't gotten much attention is beyond me. Boehm wrote a book in 1981 called \"Software Economics\" which touches on the idea of \"value\" in software development, however, it wasn't until much later that value considerations were now a major focus of research in the area of software engineering. If I had to take a best guess approach as to why the field has only recently been getting more and more attention, it would be probably because software development projects are continuously failing (as stated in the CHAOS report). Value-based software engineering is attempt at resolvoing many of the listed project failures in the CHAOS report. 2. I didn't pick up on any drawbacks to value-based SE. Are you aware of any? Time - Employing a value-based methodology by definition requires a lot more stakeholder involvement than current projects are used to. Having everyone know exactly what is valuable to the client\/stakeholder might seem too cumbersome and time consuming for some which might inflate time lines to get the required \"value proposition.\" Separation of concerns - A lot of individuals believe strongly in seperation of concerns. Business analysts determine the business requirements, the software develop implements a solution on those requirements etc... some individuals are relunctant to change the whole \"your responsibility\/my responsibility\" paragidm that is still prevailent in the industry. A value-based approach to software development discourages people from only seeing things at task level and encourages everyone to see things in a wholistic manner and to ensure that whatever the stakeholder values, is actually put in place. It would be hard to implement a different approach to software engineering if there is a strong resistance from individuals. Determining what is valuable - Determining a stakeholder's value proposition is easier said then done. There are many issues with trying to extract or elicit such value propositions, issues dealing with conflicting values of stakeholders etc... Metrics and Measurement - How does one truly measure value? Value can be subjective, qualitative, and quantitative.

Second in one of your examples (all were good by the way) you said that according to Pareto testing the company would lose money by doing complete tests my question is how much money would the company lose if a problem was found at a customer site? Just to put it in perspective, I work in the auto industry if we send a part that wasn't fully tested and a problem is discovered in the customer site we are charged in access of 1 million dollars in some cases more than we would have made if the part was good. My question is in your opinion is it a good idea to not fully test software before its released since each end customer may use it in different situations or use different parts of the software even though the value of doing testing increases cost for the company upfront? Again this presentation was really good and informative.

Here are the answers to your questions: 1. In your opinion do you think the project managers should do a thorough stakeholder analysis? Completely. However this stakeholder analysis is an iterative approach. As changes in project occur so do the needs and wants of its stakeholders. In order to be have a project continuously in touch with the value proposition of a stakeholder, it must be continuously be reevaluated. 2. According to Pareto testing the company would lose money by doing complete tests my question is how much money would the company lose if a problem was found at a customer site? Just for clarification, the company doesnt loose money by doing the ATG testing methods. It simply contains a lower maximum return on investment. Pareto testing would allow for a return on investment of 74% by executing only 40% of the most valuable test cases where as ATG allows for return of investment of 22% after 100% of test cases. They are both profitable ventures, it just depends on your value proposition. In this case, its a trade off between return on invesment and completion of test case coverage. I believe this question falls inline with the issue of when companies should do a recall of a particular part such as Sony's battery recall (http:\/\/hardware.slashdot.org\/article.pl?sid=06\/09\/29\/150209). Usually the criteria is as follows: class action lawsuits cost > cost of recall Same goes for the testing approach. If the return on investment from not testing a small subset of functionality that only some people use is greater than the cost of a customer finding a bug, then it might be worthwhile to not test it. Apart from that, you definitely raise a good point about the difference between say a product that you can ship such as Windows XP and say a web application. In one scenario you might not have any control over rectifying the flaw (Which means you would need to update the product and ship back out again) versus fixing the problem and redeploying to the web server. There is definately a different cost associated with the type of software you are developing. 3. In your opinion is it a good idea to not fully test software before its released since each end customer may use it in different situations or use different parts of the software even though the value of doing testing increases cost for the company upfront? My opinion is that you definately should never ship any software without any bugs however, the reality of the situation is, sometimes is more valuable to do so (remember value does not always equate to monetary terms). Boehm's argument is it doesn't matter what your opinion is, just the opinion of the stakeholders. A classic example is first to market criteria. Often times, developers are told to write buggy code just so that they can complete the project in time so that they can be first to market. Even though they know that the code will need to be completly rewritten i.e. no OO design, hard coding IP addresses etc... this is a tremendous cost, however, if the value proposition of the stakeholder was simply the be first to market, then cost wouldnt and shouldnt be a factor.","courseId":143,"phaseId":3,"postId":41727,"postCreationTime":1221943565,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":41723,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d309036"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":14941,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda"},{"postUserId":4240,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"As long as those extra zero's go into my bank account then no problem .

I can appreciate the challenges you had with the paper, with its large breadth and lack of depth. Considering those challenges, you worked well with the material. It was nice how you went out and sought out other papers to help complement the material and provide some context. The content was clear and it was good how you outlined the paper's goals, provided definitions, etc. What was also quite good was how much time you spent tying it into the course, as well as your critique. A couple minor quibbles: * I think it's CHAOS not CHOAS. * It's been mentioned before that the pace was fast. Thankfully the material was easy to process so the rate wasn't too much of a challenge. * The slides didn't, at least for me, always seem to be fully in sync with the audio. The only thing that kept coming to mind through the entire thing was the qualitative measures of value and how there must be ways to quantify important things in non-monetary ways. I was thinking about industries where the software being written is real-time and more mission-critical, involving aspects of our lives that could mean life or death. In those cases is it enough to say 90% of our profits come from this segment of society, and we're not going to concern ourselves as much with the other segments. I guess that gets us into things like the value of reputation (you won't be in business very long if even 1% of your customers end up dead on table or fall from the sky). I guess that ties in a bit with one of your last comments in the \"how does it relate to comp610\" section; I'm speaking of your referring to the imortance of \"[avoiding] vague and unverifiable requirements which depend for their interpretation on subjective judgment\". Is that necessarily a contradiction to what Boehm is saying? I haven't read Boehm, but my sense of it having heard your presentation is that when he talks about value that he'd always be trying to come up with some sort of objective measure of value for any \"requirement\", even for requirements that might be more qualitative. I would think that if a requirement is being assessed, and it's vague, and the value of it is not clear, that the project manager would need to dig deeper into the matter, talk to stakeholders, and broaden his\/her understanding of what the \"requirement\" is all about, and whether it should really be a \"requirement\". I might be going of on a total tangent here, but it seems that whether a requirement has been satisfied has to be decided during acceptance testing, and there's got to be some sort of concrete measure of that success so it can be assessed. And I wonder if the requirement has gone through whatever process it needed to go through to get to that level of understanding by stakeholders whether it's possible for them to not also be able to quantify the value. (Even with things that might be considered vague such as cosmetics, I think there must be ways to come up with estimates of value .... what percent of the population will spend x amount more just because the product has the right cosmetics, for example. I imagine it's hard to do, but marketing companies must do it all the time. A company like Apple must have a good sense of the value of cosmetics and what it means to their bottom line.)

You asked some tough questions! 1. Quality of the Presentation I definately had a lot of problems in doing these presentations. I have huge encoder issues (the first time it has colour and sound issues), for some reason there is about 30 sec lag at the end of the presentation between the audio and the video. I couldnt figure out to fix this. As for the CHOAS, definately a typo on my part. I'm glad spell check works so well these days. 2. Reputation is one thing that Boehm did not mention in his paper. Boehm simplistic example basically stated that if an organization only cared about ROI, then proceeding with Pareto testing as opposed to ATG would be a more valuable undertaking for the organization. You are absolutely right when you say that in certain industries you cannot discount a particular segment of customers. In the event of an organization such as this, the stakeholder's would (or should) realize that only testing a subset of their software is too damaging (how can you put a price tag on a life?). 3. Quantifiable Requirements are said to ensure that \u201Cvague and unverifiable requirements which depend for their interpretation on subjective judgment\u201D are not to be used. I see where you are going with your point. You are correct in stating that its the organization's goal of digging deeper to find out exactly what a particular requirement is. However, i guess the angle I was going with this was that you cannot discount a requirement if it is not unverifiable or vague. This implies that there is a source of value in there somewhere and that as you said, it must be extracted. 4. But it seems that whether a requirement has been satisfied has to be decided during acceptance testing. Value does not necessarily equate to meeting all of your requirements. In the Pareto\/ATG example. Value for this business was to get the highest rate of return. Whereas the requirement might have been to update the interface for different client's to renew their subscriptions. Another example is if the client wanted the software out the door a month earlier than you delivered it, even if you met every requirement, the fact that it was a month late might mean the different between the client finding your software valuable vs not valuable. 5. As for your comment of measure of success, you are absolutely right. You need something at the end of the day to say that something is valuable over something not being valuable. But no tools or mature theory currently exists to do such analysis. This is one area or future area of work that is still a work in progress in VBSE. Let me know if Ive answered your questions :) Or if any other lingering pop up.","courseId":143,"phaseId":3,"postId":41809,"postCreationTime":1222025453,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":41782,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d302ad4"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":14941,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Christian Piron-Chen - Value-Based Software Engineering: Overview and Agenda"},{"postUserId":1436,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Christian, I think you addressed all my questions.

Pareto Testing - Could be ideal if an organization faced limited resources, and needed to move those resources that would test the remaining 60% of the test cases at a negative return on investment onto something else that would yield a positive return on investment. ATG - As Grant pointed out, there are cases where we need every component of software to be working no matter how valuable it is (software in medical systems for example). In such a case, there is a huge value in making sure that everything works.

It was a crisp and precise presentation of the materials; especially considering you covered a lot of content. An interesting notion on the discussion of value - There is the monetary context which Boehm talks about, and of course, revenue matters. As do goodwill and extrinsic value. Or as you stated, \"Value is an arbitrary term that can mean the number of smiles on the face of your stakeholder.\" So I suppose on that vein of thought, that often influential clients are perceived to be more \"valuable\". On the flip side of that coin, the medium or small business may not have the clout to bring the extra value to a business. When we are acting based on value, do we perhaps disenfranchise some organizations within the client base? This was a thought provoking presentation for me.

Within many organizations, \"monetary\" considerations or revenue is the bottom line value proposition for many stakeholders.

Within my organization, we are careful in the terminology we use for our bigger clients because we do not want our other clients thinking that we do not \"value\" them.

There is definitely a different perspective as to \u201Cbusiness\u201D decisions that are made with respect to the type of client you are.

Think of it as a proof of concept to jog ones thoughts to think outside the box as traditional activities during the software development lifecycle may not actually bring the right kind of value back to its stakeholders. So to answer you first question directly, there was no real evidence in Boehm\u2019s paper that would signal that pareto analysis was a technique that was used or should be used necessary within the SDLC. As for your second question, \u201Cvalue\u201D of software and \u201Cvalue\u201D of your stakeholders though interrelated, are not necessarily the same. Boehm\u2019s main argument is that you need to know what is really valuable to your stakeholders. If your stakeholders cared more about timelines than code quality, then perhaps its more valuable to have developers worry about simply meeting the functional requirements as opposed to worry about architectural designs and generalization of modules for future scalability and customization.

Thanks! Being one of the first was pretty hard given that I had to submit the end of the second week. It didn't give me much time to play around with the recording software :( But in the end it all worked out except for that gradual lag between video and audio that I could not rectify. As for your questions here are the answers: 1. ATG Vs Paretto Testing ATG is an automated test generation tool. It essentially runs and creates tests cases that can be run automatically with little to no user interaction. Paretto testing in this paper was an approach to testing that assuming you knew what your most valuable test cases were, you would test only those ones as they created a higher return on investment. As to the preferred testing method as outlined by Boehm, he doesn't have one. The point he was trying to illustrate was that you need to know exactly what your stakeholders want. What do they feel is \"valuable?\" As such, in a fictitious organization, if they had limited to no resources, and they had other projects which were going to bring them more revenue, then their value proposition might be to maximize their return on investment. Boehm's point was that every activity within the SDLC needs to take into account this value proposition (in this case it was return on investment). Thus, QA activities in most cases would test every aspect of the software prior to releasing it. However, this is not a valuable activity for the organization given their value proposition. The organization would want to do Paretto testing as this would free up resources and maximize the return on investment for the organization.

OK - I've got to ask!!  In the first two case studies, it was indicated the gender of the subjects (male, female).  I didn't pick up why that distinction was made.  Maybe the females asked better questions?   Seriously though, why was that specifically mentioned?  How did gender matter in the two cases, if at all?  I'm struggling with this concept about how we \"need\" tools to answer questions as identified in the article for us. Is that because we still do not do a good job of properly coding and documenting our code? Or maybe it's because it's just easier for us to get the answer that way?  Thanks!

And it did seem to be biased towards the males. I think when doing the study the authors just happen to have more males for testing than females. They mentioned it just to give a greater clarification of all the parameters involved in the project. As you can see that at the end they clearly mention that if different tools or participants were used completely different results may have occurred. This actually keeps open the option for somebody else to do the same study with females and compare the results. Tools are required as they provide a more definitive view of the programming changes. Without tools changes would be more arbitrary. Even though lots of programmers dont use tools but as the study suggested that using tools may provide a better set of question and more improved changes. Thank you.

Since this is a generic study a more technical set of questions were focussed. Attached is the complete set of 44 questions that were asked. Since the number of questions asked were too high, it was difficult to focus on one area. Hence the chances of getting a concrete result becomes lower. The more questions asked, the broader the study base becomes and hence the focus widens. I think that if this study can be divided into sub-studies then results will be clearer.

I totally agree with you. The authors seemed to be unsure about the way to reach their goal. Hence they kinda messed up the contributors of the study. You are right that the study should have been more controlled. As far as the gender bias is concerned, I have a strong feeling, which I have already mentioned in one of my previous posts, that the authors just started the study with a group of students and participants and they just happened to be almost all males. If they omitted the gender distribution in their participation parameter, I think there would have been less controversies. I think some of the sub-groups may be based on participants with purely educational experience, programmers with less than one year experience, programmers with 2-5 years experience and 5 years or more. As they have mentioned the gender of the participants, all the above groups can be all male and all female separate sub-groups. Hope I was able to answer to your queries.

The presentation was created on a 4 year-old XP SP3 build laptop, with a Dynex headset picked up from FutureShop last week, which may be why there is a perceptable background 'buzz' which could not be dampened. I used Open Office 2.4 Impress, and was not impressed with the quality of the slides captured to AVI, this maybe has something to do with the default options on CamStudio, but i'm not sure. CamStudio 2.0 was awesome after i figured out where the 'hotkeys' were for starting and stopping the recording and the audio options for the microphone. But i was dissappointed with what i thought was a 'full screen' capture, though i think this was a limitation of Open Office. I used an unregistered 7-day freebe of AVI Joiner 1.02 and AVI Splitter 2.11 to join and edit all the AVI's together after i thought \"Why am i trying to do this presentation all in 'one shot'\"...and that was just last nite! And i think i might have been a little too aggressive with editing and splicing the files, in some spots it feels pretty 'choppy' and should have been rerecorded. The Riva FLV Encoder 02.00.0004 was able to bring down the 750MB AVI to a more managable 57MB, which i think makes it worth the additional loss of video quality for the most part. I also had to create a new user account for VShare...I tried to use my original cred's all morning and was not able to upload the file, once i had the new account the upload page displayed and i was able to upload the file in about 20 minutes. I definitely over-thought the presentation and with a time value 'way' under the time limit, i should have used that extra time to add some more detail (i.e. Stochastic Petri Net Model). I think it might have been better to have presented earlier so as not to rework that original energy.

Thanks for the presentation. Early on (well before I heard your references to applicability) I had a different take on the aim. The following quote (my emphasis) sets up my perspective on this presentation: \"Too little time and effort is devoted to non-functional validation of software systems ...\" So, this leads me to see this as a method of elaborating on or developing the requirements - specifically the improvement or even discovery of performance based requirements. Without these requirements a specification might say \"the system must perform function x.\" But using such a method the analyst\/engineer can say \"the system must perform function x in no more than y seconds else the system fails.\" So - am I off base entirely?

There seems to be some consensus that the use of non-functional validation to develop and improve performance based requirements is an ideal which rarely occurs. These two requirements are deemed to be at cross purposes, looking at the problem from different directions, without the abitilty to integrate results.

I liked as well how you presented the slides with animation demonstrating a good understanding of the concepts. I was a little surprised that part of the performance analysis only response time was considered. In my experience, even response time is the pass\/fail determining factor, other factors ie throughput are more critical in determining system performance. For example, a system performance degrades linearly as the throughput grows up to a breaking point. This is important as well as in a normal system it usually changes during usage with high peaks and lower throughput that can trigger a system to fail. My only question if this paper considers any other factors in determining the risk of failure. Again, good topic and an excellent presentation.

I have always been concerned with the 'death-by-powerpoint' issue and try to apply PresentationZen's concepts as much as i can. Nothing is worse than giving a presentation and watch your audience 'go blank' when you are trying to put your idea or point across. I'm also a big Edward Tufte fan. Agreed, throughput can be deemed more critical, but the authors were interested in an 'excessively' long response time and stated it was not their intention to solve resource related problems. Mr. Cortellessa's work seems to have moved in this direction, though, since writing the paper. I'm thinking their methodology was to try and deal with stakeholders concerns first and not the systems, whereby, in Step 3 a performance result failure in Zone (Z3), by their method, would be brought back to the analyst to resolve before performing any further steps. I wonder, too, if the point was to show how easily the methodology could be applied earlier in the life cycle, so during 'real world' tests, response times would not be a factor as a point-of-failure, and allow for better allocation of analytical resources to specific areas of the system.

For me, the slides were a bit wordy, so I ended up just listening to you and waiting for the pictures. Hopefully that's not indicative of anything more than my reading level. As far as more technical comments go, I'm actually trying to get my head fully around the ideas. Here are a couple though: 1. What is performance? Is it linked to how fast a task can be completed? Can the term be used for other aspects of quality? I guess you said that there can be time related failures and resource related failures and that this paper focused on the former. 2. When setting up one of these risk analysis, how do you assess whether or not your model accurately describes the real world situation? How do you ensure that the model is complex enough that it's not glossing over relationships that could actually prove to be critical? I imagine that when setting up a model that you'd need to review your assumptions to ensure that you don't overlook something. 3. When it came to their case studies was there any attempt to assess how well the model and the probabilities that it came up with ended up matching with reality? Thanks, Andrew.

Agreed, some of the slides were wordy. I tried my best to keep verbage to a minimum, and with the depth of the technical paper I think I did a pretty good job. 'Performance' in the paper was linked to an objective of minimum workload with response time in order to devise a risk factor. Of course performance can be used for other aspects of quality, but the purpose was to point out another way of evaluating software other than resource-related. Isn't that the aim of modeling software? Develop a model as close to 'real world', find potential issues and 'risk', then make modifications before it before it reaches the Gold release. This test and resolution of issues before software gets to market is where the authors have their slant with a safety-critical system having potentially critical flaws (maybe this is why most of the subsequent research has largely been confined to government systems). Definitely agree with your point about flaws in modeling, what if a use-case is missed or misinterpreted because assessments are run too early in the process without enough data? The authors even presented their concern about this, and where I think it was correct to point out the potential of flirting with software verification not included in this course outline.

It was clear and easy to follow. I too questioned the use of Smalltalk as the choice for the OO language and the use of perceived effort over actual effort.  I think C++ would have been  a better choice than Smalltalk or Java. C++ is more popular than Smalltalk. C++ is older than Java and thus legacy OO code is more apt to be in C++. Also C++ not having automatic garbage collection means it is harder to maintain. What do you think? The university the authors used must have taught OO languages other than Smalltalk. Have you seen any other empirical studies of this kind that use more appropriate OO languages? From a revenue and cost perspective I think the two most important function changing maintenance categories are the first two that you listed, enhancement and correction. The authors of the paper only looked at enhancements. From the Guide to the SWEBOK (2004) about 20% of maintenance is for corrective actions. Hence the effort to make corrections is significant. So follow on research that did the same study but included changes to enhance and correct the software would be of great interest. Have you come across anything like this?

Yes, I agree with you that C++ would be the best choice as it is widely used in industry and as you point out is harder to maintain. I don\u2019t understand their choice either, as the authors must be familiar and teach either C++ or Java or both! Microsoft has a program called the MSDN Academic Alliance, which for a very reasonable cost (below$1,000 I believe) gives universities and colleges access to most Microsoft software including Visual Studio with Visual C++. In fact, through this agreement, students can legally install and use the software on home computers. The college where I work has this agreement. It saves us thousands of dollars and is great for students. So why the authors didn\u2019t choice C++ (or Java which is free) is a big limitation in my opinion. I found one empirical study that compared C to C++ for software maintenance: Effect of object orientation on maintainability of software Kiran, G.A.; Haripriya, S.; Jalote, P.; Software Maintenance, 1997. Proceedings., International Conference on 1-3 Oct. 1997 Page(s):114 - 121 Digital Object Identifier 10.1109\/ICSM.1997.624237 This study used the metrics: -actual effort (man-hours) -change volume (the number of LOC changed or added) -change locality(how localized or spread out the changes were) Unfortunately the maintenance was limited to extending functionality, adding new functionality, changing existing functionality and deleting existing functionality. They did not look at corrective maintenance. This study found that in most (not all cases) object-oriented design took less effort, had a lower change volume, and the changes more localized.

The paper you referenced was quite interesting. I am glad they measured actual effort.

The OO languages are Turing equivalent. So the computational power is there. But doing maintenance on Smalltalk vs C++ vs Java is quite different. So I wonder what specific language features make maintenance harder to do? Some features that come to mind include explicit memory management, reflection, annotation, the ability to self modify code and the like.

I would suggest the measure to use for actual effort is the amount of time taken to complete the maintenance task. A common unit used in projects is man-hours as this scales from small to large projects. Using man-hours is important from a practical point of view because it allows for the comparison of costs between the different approaches. The authors\u2019 objectives were vague. Basically the purpose was \u201Cto extend the body of knowledge\u201D. I feel the experiment does meet their objective. I do agree with you that the study seems to be inconclusive. It is inconclusive from a practical perspective. Many of us want and need concrete results that we can apply in our jobs. As IT practioners we want to know which language is best, what provides the least effort and lowest cost, etc. What the study does do well is analyze the various steps in the maintenance process (planning, knowledge building, diagnosis, and modification) and it shows how the languages perform on each step. Software maintenance is a complex process with many factors affecting the outcome. I feel this study makes the complexity very clear! I feel using experienced programmers working on real projects (study a sufficient number of projects) could validate this study. The assignment in this study was too simple in my opinion, so actual cases studies would be better. Measuring both perceived effort and actual effort (man-hours) would test for a correlation between the two. One of the important questions is whether or not there are differences between languages of a given type, for example SmallTalk, C++, or Java for object-oriented. C++ would be the preferred language (see John\u2019s post and my answer). A thorough study would need to compare a number of languages using numerous maintenance projects to determine if there are differences between languages of a given type.

I do agree the limitation pointed out by the authors, especially with complexity. I believe that OO languages have more advantages when dealing with complex problem. The task used in the paper is too simple and it is hard to tell which is better. As we all know, the advantage of OO languages are higher level of abstraction and more modulated structure. For example, with OO languages, we can easily reuse existing component\/class to implement new feature by inheritance and composition. On the contrary, 3gl usually are lack of such flexibility. Actually, I am more interested about the maintenance effort based on different architecture styles or methodologies being used. Language is only a small part of a large software system. For example, in SOA, people can use all kinds of different languages to develop web service. The difference of maintenance that comes from programming language itself is relatively small. The major effort will be focused on the distributed environment, architecture modification, security, documentation update, etc... I think this could be a more interesting topic to research.

Yes, this task was too simple (even for students) to draw conclusions from. It does have some interesting results, which should be studied further. For example, the perceived effort was lower for 3GL language in the planning and diagnosis stage. Maybe for larger complex projects the O-O language would have the lower perceived effort for the reasons you gave (structure, component\/class reuse, inheritance). Students did the maintenance in this study. It is possible that experienced programmers would make greater use of the advantages of O-O languages and thus the maintenance effort would be lower compared to 3GL. You made a good point that different architecture styles and methodologies may have a greater affect on maintenance than the language used. There seems to be so much more research that can be done regarding software maintenance!

The author's study is a bit controversial as it jumps to rather big conclusion from a very limited study. COBOL is a proven industry language that has been used a couple of decades ago while Smalltalk is not all that popular in the industry, it's more of academia language. So each language of choice for this paper is not exactly true representative of each type of the language. The sample group was chosen rather poorly by author among students as most of the students do not write code that is easy to maintain (I recall back from my university days, you would get full marks if your program was working according to specifications and the only criteria for maintainability was certain volume of comments per class\/function). Also the task may haven't been well suited for Smalltalk or COBOL. After all language is just a tool you choose to solve a particular problem and some languages are just not well suited for solving certain problems (like java for running real-time software or C++ for creating complex and user-friendly GUI interfaces).

Every researcher would love to have a study in a company with a number of very experienced developers where they have enough developers to be able to achieve an expected level of statistical power. Alright - now back to the reality - which company is going to give us at least 20-30 programmers to participate in a study for the whole week or two (N.B. typically such a study will require at least 60-80 even more to have a statistical power at the level of 80%). Let's be very modest - which company will let us conduct an empirical research for 3-4 hours in two sessions (also what can be done in such an amount of time). One can say, try with several, sure, but then you are facing another problem of various cultures, backgrounds, experience practices, ability to conduct the experiment under the same conditions (basic principle of any research!) etc. And, results are again invalid and we can not draw and significant conclusions. Sometimes, companies are even willing to give you money to do some research, but don\u2019t mess up with their personnel?! Well, they don't say so, but. For example, once we only even want to observe (not even ask anything) how say their developers do certain tasks, there are millions of problems, which typically result in project failures or with too little data to draw any significant conclusions. Here, even if we have a commitment in a written form does not help usually. Companies have different priorities from researchers, and mangers need to achieve their day-to-day and planned activates. Yet, companies would like to have valid results and complain that researchers do not give them results. This is a well-known chicken-egg problem in research, and a constant problem animosity of the parties. This implicates that the researches did not poorly selected their participants, but they had to work with those developers they have an access to and they were able to recruit to take part in their study. It might not what someone may want to see in terms of the target group, but this research is methodologically valid and researchers followed proper standards of research. They also discussed the limitations of their research, reported the background and level of knowledge of their participants, so that everyone can reproduce their experiment. If someone else would like to have another group, that one needs to find the group and conduct that experiment. However, never say that someone else had a poor choice of the group selection if the study is valid, as this one. If the authors had an access to another group of participants, do you really think that they wouldn't do their study with them?! And this is not just a problem of SE research, and many other areas are facing the same problem and following the same direction of empirical research. Yet, we are obtaining some very important research findings even in this way. One study is just a drop in a sea of other research projects and results. Finally, in terms of empirical knowledge and advancement of our understanding of how developers (and people in general) do certain tasks in software maintenance, it is much better have this type of studies, as the lessons learned are methodologically and empirically valid, and they produce new research knowledge, which would not have otherwise. Finally, I would be very carefully to say that some research published in a leading international journal which passed the peer-review process by the international well-known experts in the field who are looking forward to letting you down (well, they are not that bad :-)) if they notice any research weakness. This is also an important point to keep in mind when giving such observation in your other TMAs in this course and anywhere else as holders of master's degrees. They will lead to serious mark deductions in this course. This is not to prevent to think critically, but to stimulate to think critically based on the scientifically validated facts and understanding of the research problems and practices. Every time you find another similar issue, think very carefully why those people had to take such an approach Regards, Dragan","courseId":172,"phaseId":0,"postId":49610,"postCreationTime":1243491535,"courseCategoryId":15,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Spring\/09 Archive","postParentId":49603,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d303b81"},"forumId":1016,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":17401,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 S09","postTitle":"Re: The Process Of Software Maintenance: A Comparison Of Object-Oriented And Third Generation Development Languages","courseCategoryName":"Grad Spring\/09 Archives","topicName":"The Process Of Software Maintenance: A Comparison Of Object-Oriented And Third Generation Development Languages"},{"postUserId":3921,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Yevgeniy, Thank you for your feedback and your comments. There are many factors that affect software maintenance. The posts from the others in our class have pointed out additional ones I hadn\u2019t considered while researching this paper. Software maintenance is a complex process! The authors did control all the variables and varied just the language. This allowed them to measure how an O-O language compares to 3GL in terms of perceived effort. My understanding is that the diagram of the \u201CResearch Model\u201D is meant to convey this. Having too many dependent variables would have flawed the study or made the results impossible to understand. Yes, there are many limitations to the study, but the authors did discuss most of them. The study does provide two important results: that there seems to be different thought processes used by programmers of O-O vs 3GL languages and that there are differences between languages for the various steps involved in software maintenance. The authors do not make any claims that one type of language is better than the other. The objective of the study was to further knowledge in this area. Thus, it meets the objective. Yes, it raises many questions for future research, for example how does the language, the complexity of the task, the type of maintenance, and the experience of the programmer affect maintenance. There is so much more research that can be done to test the affects of these and other factors on software maintenance. Maybe the best way to think of this study, is that it is a necessary \u201Cfirst step\u201D which could lead to further research and answers these questions.

Very easy to follow and understand. As you pointed out software maintenance is a very complex process let alone trying to figure out what programming paradigm is better at it. Like you and many others, I personally thought the test were too simple and not enough factors were taken into account. One of the main factors I think, and this was also pointed out by another fellow student, is the fact that some tools are better at solving particular problems. Sometimes OO would be better and more natural but not always. That's the main reason why Python has become my favourite programming language. It's true object oriented (everything actually IS an object as oppose to Java) but you can also script when scripting is a better option (a system tasks for instance). Do you also think this should be a factor that should be taken into account in this kind of research? If so, how would you suggest doing it? Surely it would be more complex than comparing the perceived effort of adding a simple feature like was done. Maybe too complex?

While I feel the maintenance task was too simple, the experiment was well set up. The authors controlled all the variables (such as the type of maintenance, the complexity of the task, the experience of the programmers) and varied only the programming language. If too many factors are changed, the experiment would be flawed as it would be difficult, if not impossible, to understand any of the results. Testing other factors for their affect on software maintenance could be done using the same approach used in this paper. This would require doing a number of experiments where in each one all the factors are controlled (made the same) except for one. Other metrics could be used such as actual effort in man-hours, LOC changed, or locality of change. Which metric is \u201Cbest\u201D could be another topic for future research! I am not a programmer by profession but I think scripting languages could be compared to other languages using an experiment similar to the one in this paper. I agree with you that the programming language is just a tool and some tools are better at solving particular problems. Often tools are chosen for the \u201Cupfront benefits\u201D and the \u201Cbackend\u201D challenges\/costs are not considered. Research into software maintenance helps software engineers understand the \u201Cbackend\u201D performance of the tool, which should help them choose the best tool for a project.

The topic is actually quite close to me, because in a past life I spent an uncountable number of hours maintaining other people's code written in 3GLs...some of them written well, some of them written exceptionally poorly. It seems the authors were looking only at effort. Some might propose that a more important consideration might be the nature of the change, not just how hard it was to make, or at least that both concepts are important. For example, what happens when you modify prematurely, without enough investigation? Whether you've actually made the correct enhancement, if you introduce some other error, its effect on the overall effort to correct is much higher. This is actually a painfully common issue. Did the authors address this element of the maintenance problem at all? Also, if we assume that the authors selected students intentionally - for example, this might provide access to a sizeable pool of programmers of varying skill levels - did they propose further examples with this same pool of students to test their increasing familiarity with the code over time? This might provide some insights into the effect of increased experience, which could mitigate some of the perceived weaknesses of using students rather than experienced programmers. As a future research topic, I would suggest investigating some standards or frameworks around management of change, and how this can effect maintenance effort in the larger scope, over the lifetime of an application.

There are few empirical studies comparing the affect of programming language on software maintenance. The authors of the paper also made this observation and it was one of the reasons they completed this empirical study. This paper was the only empirical study I found that divided software maintenance into a number of steps and studied the affects of the language on each step. The final step used in this paper, modification, does include \u201Cerror management\u201D which involves making the changes and testing the changes. It\u2019s interesting that this is the only step without significant difference in perceived effort between the languages. The reason for this could be the small program and simple maintenance tasked used. There would be little \u201Cripple effect\u201D through the other components. So maybe the language has little affect on the modification step but other factors do? Another interesting area to research further!

As the authors of the paper I researched state, software maintenance is mainly a cognitive task. Understanding the code and determining what changes to make are the cognitive tasks requiring most of the effort. Modifying the code is then relatively straightforward and requires much less cognitive effort. Thus it seems to make sense that the more information available to anyone maintaining code such as documentation, the easier the code should be to maintain. This does bring up more interesting questions such as: How does the quality of the documentation affect maintainability? Is poor (or incorrect) documentation better or worse than having no documentation? Does documentation provide less benefit for experienced programmers since they can use knowledge gained through experience? Do the features of O-O languages such as inheritance, de-location, etc. make documentation even more beneficial than with a 3GL?

The authors did not really provide any suitable concrete benefit and more importantly way to obtain usability standards within WE. With that said, if *I* had to answer your questions, I would say that the key benefit of this research is simply realizing that programming standards do in fact change with every new type of programming out there. It isn't a stagnant science, and needs constant updates. The proposed modeling to lead to the solutions of their \"top 5 problems\" would be something that incorporated their holy grail of web development : usability analysis. Beyond that, anything is pure conjecture on my part. So, although nothing was ever stated as solid factual proof of theories (I suspect done on purpose to be as vauge as possible) I do think that there is merit to the theory, but the trick is in the implementation.

My very first contract work that I obtained while doing my undergrad was for the government. A set fixed amount was offered and I accepted. The problem: I soon realized WHY I won the contract: I undercut myself so much that I ended up working 5 times what I should have ... communication was a total failure and I soon started hating the project. So, I can speak from personal experience, communication is indeed key. For your 2nd point, I think that the web is such a fickle mistress, and that most sites are done by contractors that no, and SOA simply is just too much work for one offs. After all, most of the web is still \"Ma and Pa\" type sites, so I expect that any attempt at standardizing or developing a overall architecture is just going to fail. So yes, WIS should be a architecture-agnostic (I *LOVE* that term.. I am officially copyrighting it... haha). Thanks for the great points and questions!

As a suggestion, you said that you had recorded everything in the highest res \/ quality possible. That was likely your mistake. You would have probably ended up with a better quality product on vShare if you had reduced your audio quality and screen size, as then you would have had more control of what the final product looked like, rather than letting the system make the choices for you. But, while the audio was 'tinny', your voice was clear, well paced, and, if the system had not 'adjusted' the presentation for you, would have been excellent. One problem I have with the paper is the claim that web programming is inherently different than traditional programming. Yes, some of the specific tools and languages are different, but I see many similarities between web programming and the 3GL programming (or any other screen based client server programming) that was common in the 80s. Of course there are differences, but not, I believe, enough to justify the claim that it is inherently a different beast. But, enough of my personal rant. The authors felt that the WIS model did not have the ability to deal with their usability requirements. Did they look at any of the HCI (Human - Computer Interaction) models? This is where I would have normally expected to find usability issues discussed.

They relied on TagViewer since they were using the transcripts from the video. Here is a quote from the article: \"Participants in the tagging condition spent considerably less time looking at their notes and at their requirements document than the video-only condition, and spent that time focused on TagViewer. Additionally, several of the tagging participants had less than one page of notes, which resulted in nearly complete lack of use of their notes, and substantial use of TagViewer. Our analysis also revealed that TagViewer may reduce the number of knowledge misrepresentations and inaccuracies, errors that are important to avoid in requirements activities Additionally, TagViewer aided participants in finding specific details they may otherwise have left out. For example, one participant played back a segment of the video several times to hear exactly what color and font size the pilots suggested to show accomplished versus unaccomplished items. That participant was then able to write down those details using the pilot\u2019s words, which no other participant did. The potential improvement in accuracy through greater elaboration of details is also difficult to quantify in this small study. \u201D According to the authors, TagViewer was very helpful for the participants who used it.

Q : Since the 'tags' must be determined, what is the chance of missing one or more important ones in the identification process? Ans: Yes, the possible is there to miss the tags. It is one of reason the authors are planning to have the tags generated automatically in the future. Q: How difficult would it be to add them in after the interviews are completed? Ans: Yes, you can add the missing tags after the interview, by rerunning the video. It might be a little tricky if the video is longer but you can skim the video by clicking tags that are already there. Q: How is the text captured? Ans: The transcript is generated automatically, so the developer does not really need to take a lot of notes, but also the automatically generated transcript has some errors in it. Q: The screen shot shows the text with the highlighted tags, where does this text come from - is it typed manually, captured automatically as it is spoken, etc? Ans: Yes, it is done manually but for future work the author is planning to have the tags generated automatically To Quote the author: \u201D Multimedia information retrieval is concerned with automatically producing indices into audio and video using a variety of speech and text mining techniques, such as the work by Kubala et al. [8]. We would like to investigate how these techniques can be used to automatically generate tags, particularly the domain-specific tags. But the richness of indexing we are exploring is still beyond automated techniques. \u201D Q: Do you see potential problems where informal meetings are held and requirements are stated, but they are not recorded on video? Ans: Yes, I can see the potential problems, if they are no recorded video. I think decisions will be made with potentially missing important facts or misinterpretation of facts from the initial conversation.

Q: In your presentation you said that the system the Author presented is different from many meeting capture, can you elaborate on this by giving some examples of other meeting capture and the difference?

The Inclusive part of the study was dropped by the authors, since the particularities of that specific area in the study (quantitative estimate) are not adding or subtracting anything any values to the conclusion of that study. So, the quantitative results of the research were considered inconclusive.

I would have loved to see one with 1) more time to the students. The interview was 1 hour and they had 45 minutes to write their document. The non-tagged students would not have had enough time to completely view the video a second time. 2) possibly a third group of students who have an untagged transcript. 3) a larger sample size so that there is a better chance that the results can be statistically significant. -rob","courseId":196,"phaseId":4,"postId":58107,"postCreationTime":1265149910,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57929,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306d7f"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19979,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: An Empirical Investigation of Capture and Access for Software Requirements Activities","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"An Empirical Investigation of Capture and Access for Software Requirements Activities"},{"postUserId":1364,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"HI Rob, Q: Was there discussion about how the transcript was generated and tagged?

Even though I've never used such video, I can see how its usage can be more efficient than a plain video.  Only problem I find with this is the actual tagging process.  I believe you mentioned that the tagging has to be done manually by the video developer.  If that is the case, there's still some chance of not tagging all relevant informatoin presented. So, as you suggested, the future work should invove making this tagging process automatic by the system.  Perhaps, the system should include speech recognition and tag the video more efficiently and accurately without any manual work by a human.  Nevertheless, as the article concludes, I believe tagged video would be more beneficial in requirements gathering and documentation than a non-tagged video.

Did the authors or anywhere in the study mention tag viewer in the context of the two above trends?

In regards to the presentation itself in the section listing the 10 architectural techniques you mention that the authors added quality elements to reduce the need for \"experts\". Even though that process supplies additional information for decision making doesn't it introduce another knowledge area which makes the overall process even more \"expert\" driven? Or possibly adds the need for another team?   In a similar vein it seems to me that they are adding an extra tier to the methodology. Terms like ATAM plus clearly suggests that. Yet in the section of the paper where they discuss ROI they appear to indicate that is improved.

With ATAM, the architecture team gets to a point where they have identified a set of quality attributes and scenarios. Translating this into a candidate architecture is a \"magical\" step that occurs entirely in the head of the architect. Because the rational for the architecture is not documented, no alternatives are identified, and no further analysis of the architecture is performed, the architects just have to get it right the first time.  With APTIA, each of the architects' choices are subjected to further analysis and refinement by the rest of the design team, and the basis for decision making (better cost benefit) is made clear. This reduces the need for architectural expertise by adding opportunities to detect and correct bad choices, and by allowing more people to help generate design alternatives. The extra steps added by APTIA are pretty straightforward, and the article provides worked examples, so I don't think a lot of skill or practice would be required to steer a design team through them. The authors themselves have something to say about this: \"the point of creating a method is\u2026 so that the average architect can approximate what the best architects know and do.\" 2. The authors mention ROI in section 4, where they use it as a tool to rank the design alternatives generated during the APTIA analysis. They don't make any claims regarding the ROI of using APTIA instead of ATAM on projects. They are pretty explicit about the fact that they are adding extra steps to ATAM, and that these extra steps require time (and cost), so it's possible to talk about the ROI of the process. On a project by project basis, measuring the additional investment would be straightforward, but I have my doubts about whether a meaningful estimate of the return is possible.","courseId":245,"phaseId":2,"postId":73149,"postCreationTime":1296405346,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73124,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d307a9a"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23797,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: Presentation - Week 3","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"Presentation - Week 3"},{"postUserId":6206,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Alex, log into vshare and then paste the url in address bar.

There was really only one useful graphic in the source paper (APTIA process, top of p. 1210). I did think about including it, but in the end decided not to. Maybe that was the wrong choice. 1. The ATAM process which APTIA extends uses \"quality attributes\" to drive the analysis. These correspond to the usual notion of non-functional requirements. The scenarios used to evaluate the architecture may include use cases, representing functional requirements. ATAM occurs early in a project, and is concerned with overall architecture issues, so only critical or risky attributes and scenarios would be included in the analysis, and they will not include a lot of detail. 2. The \"ranks alternatives\" and \"make design decisions\" steps in the APTIA examples seem pretty informal -- essentially just one workshop with the design team. But you can see in section 5.4 that the project team did feel the need for a little more detail to justify their decisions. ARID could probably be used here, if it was important to do a much more detailed evaluation of the design decisions. It would really extend the time (and cost) of the analysis, though. 3.

I think the authors wanted to spend more time analyzing their architecture choices and refining the design, rather than that ATAM was defective in some way.

The authors are using the quality attributes (a.k.a. non-functional requirements) to analyze their architecture proposals (technique 9), and generate design alternatives to guide the implementation (technique 10). This is definitely more design detail work than you would normally expect from an architecture analysis, but that was the authors' goal for the new process. 3.

After this, different architecture options are analyzed, and risks (and non-risks) are identified, and the results of all of this are documented. This basically covers the ATAM part of the process. APTIA adds a bit more detailed design work and cost\/benefit analysis for architecture choices related to the most critical or risky scenarios. After this, a waterfall-style project would proceed into the design stage, and then into implementation.

I am not quite sure if I understand your question so please correct me if I am wrong. My experience with offshoring and requirments has been that your requirments have to be at a higher level then one would expect if the development was being conducted onshore. If they are not then needless development time is lost and there is increased tensions between the offshoe and onshore team. Bringing this back to the article, requirements will change and there affects need to be understood so that what the offshore team delivers is what you actually want. Thanks for the input.

After reading the paper and your presentation I guess the main question I have is given that the body of work is purely conceptual (that is the authors presented an idea without showing an actual implementation of the idea), do you think the concept requires more validity? The 3rd point in your \"Future Plans\" slide sort of hints at this. Also, given the rather informal nature of the decisions around whether requirements conflict based solely on the classification of those requirements - what is your view on the importance of the actual classification scheme? Should more research be put into the mechanics of the classification scheme prior to implementing this type of analysis?

I thought the authors did a good job going through a small example on how there findings could be applied to a real world problem.

I'm not familair with the ISO nomeclature so that may be a standard classification system can use? Otherwise I agree we need a standard classification system. 3. One thing I found was I used PowerPoint to create the slide and then used the video conversion tool which the course instructor suggested to convert it prior to uploading it. The text was quite legible when at the standard size of a PowerPoint slide but once the presentation went through the conversion process and resized into a small window I agree some text was difficult to read. Note for future work to put less text on the screen knowing that the converson process will result in smaller slides. No I was not nervous.

What would prevent such a mapping? This methodology starts the RE process with actors and goals, where the data source is never directly referenced. There may be chances that a direct mapping is not possible, although I would say that the chance is very slim. The \"if possible\" phrase is more of  a \"safe harbour\" statement. 2) Do you seen this as already starting to drive implementation decisions prior to the completion of the completion of the requirements analysis? This is the beauty of this methodology. In a data warehouse project, the most important part is what the decision makers want to see. Using actor and goal to model decision maker's needs can lead to automation from RE to actual design. 3)Also data warehousing projects do tend to be extremely large. Taking the \"actor\" and motivation aspects into account would appear to increase an already challenging scope. Do you think this increase in complexity would have a negative impact on risk factors? I don't think this will increase the complexity of a DW project. The concepts of actor and goal are only used for modeling only, and as you can see from the examples in paper that the process is clean and simple. DW design is only part of the whole DW project, if the DW is properly designed then the complexity of ETL and BI applications will be greatly reduced.

My only exposure to data warehouse modelling was in COMP 602, where it seemed like something best left to other people. :) The Tropos material really piqued my interest, though. Early in your presentation, you say that a lot of DW project fail because of poor initial requirements gathering or analysis. This sounds a lot like other software projects. How does goal-oriented analysis fit into other software development projects? One of the papers I was looking at for TMA2 uses the same kind of goal-oriented analysis and diagram notation to model interactions between web services. They used the 'formal tropos' variant, and this allowed them to automatically generate WS-CDL documents from their requirements models. Which was pretty neat. Maybe a similar technique could be used to automate or semi-automate some of the design steps from your paper? I noticed you had aspect-ratio problems with your presentation, with the sides chopped off in the embedded viewer, or the top and bottom chopped off in the full screen viewer. I had the same problem (probably everyone with a 16:9 screen will). You can use ffmpeg to correct this fairly easily: ffmpeg -i vlc1.mpg -s 800x450 -padtop 74 -padbottom 76 -padcolor ffffff  out.flv If you are starting from a 16:10 screen, you would need to adjust the numbers a bit (800x500, 50, 50). The padcolor should match the background color of your presentation.

This sounds a lot like other software projects. (I am 100% in agreement with you.) How does goal-oriented analysis fit into other software development projects? When I was in marketing in my another life, before I came to Canada, my mentor once asked me the question -  Do you want to sell what you want to sell or what the customer wants to buy? This is very similiar to IS development, do we want to deliver a system that meets the client's needs? I think goal-oriented RE answers this question. Identification of the client's goals leads to a system developed with the client's needs as the focus of the development. 2) Maybe a similar technique could be used to automate or semi-automate some of the design steps from your paper? I have to agree with you again. Further research and development in this respect will make this methodology more valuable. 3) Video Problem It is a long story .... but yes I can use ffmpeg, mencoder and transcode for all my video editing needs but they are just to powerful (with hundreds of command line options).

Requirement of Data Warehouse As per the DW maturity, it goes through reporting, trend analysis, predictive analysis and information discovery status (I remember it is 5 stage, can't remember the one).  The requirement at each maturity level are different.  I see the paper \"Goal Requirement\" approach could be used in first 3 stages, but not the Information Discovery (which is the Data Mining). 2. What is the scope of Data Warehouse If the DW is considered at Enterprise level, the fact, measure and dimension of same piece of information could be different.  Finance and Marketing could have different view of Sales transaction data; and could have different dimension and hierarchy.  If we receive two conflicting goal from two stakeholders, the approach couldn't resolve it.  You may argue this is a politic situation, but I consider as the nature of DW occur in most of the DW environment.  If the scope of DW is owned by department, which may not have this situation, I consider it is a Data Mart (i.e. not DW). 3. What is the architecture of Data Warehouse From the research paper, it prefer star schema which is very common to most organizations.  Star (or snowflake) has pros and cons, which is outside the scope of paper.  My point is some organization remains using 3NF for DW and use star schema as the performance layer to improve the response time.  Using the Goal Oriented approach, what will be the architecture or it doesn't matter ?  I can see Supply Driven will likely have 3NF because of data centric; and Demand Driven could be either (or mix).  From the perspective of implementation, cube building is generally using incremental approach to reduce the run time, changing dimension by project may need to rebuild the new cube; or create similar cube.  It will becomes an operational challenge. 4. What is relationship between your rationale diagram and information model Rationale diagram provide the relationship between goals, fact, dimension, etc.  At the end, a physcial database structure (physical data model) is required if you choose the main stream technologies, i.e. DB2, Oracle, Teradata, etc.  Data model typically use ER; and the diagram use UML like structure.  All execpt the initial DW project has a constraint, it must live with the existing structure.  Goal-driven approach does not consider existing rationale nor structure, which could be accomoated from the Supply-driven. 5. How Goal-driven and Supply-Driven complement each other The article mention that it could be supplement each other, but lacking of details.  What's your view ? Overall feedback of the Research Paper: I consider this is an execellent paper as Goal-Oriented Requirement Analysis for DW Project as opposed to Design.  I see the design paper is incomplete. Strenght: 1.  It has good analysis of the current DW approach; and try to reuse the method for addressing the problem. 2. Goal driven is not formally document; but it has been used my many professionals through stakeholder interview before they start the Supply driven approach.  The reason is the DW profession can't create data but use it.  Interview the stakeholder (executive) is Goal-driven approach anyway.  Therefore, it is not a new concern but formalize the approach use by consultant.  If approach couldn't be formalized, more DW staff could follow it and deliver values. Weakness: 1. Not considering the existing DW environment and information structure.  2. Consider information is application centric nature; instead of information.  Information maintained in a purpose of goal will be limited by goal - goal could change regardless you like it or not.  If the structure created based on goal, the structure must change (or bend) to fit the new goal and will introduce problem.  If DW is built on information relationship, it could fit in most of the goal (it will never be all).  The performance could be supplemented by the performance layer, e.g. cube and others. Alex: I see you have great interest in information and DW, may be we could work on TMA 4.  If you have interest, please let me know and we could introduce each other to see whether it will work out or not.  I know you live in BC and I live in Toronto, we could use Skype or Google phone.

Here are some thoughts of myself. 1) If we receive two conflicting goal from two stakeholders, the approach couldn't resolve it. Within the context of DW, I think there will be no conflicting goals at all. If two decision makers having conflicting goals, we can satisfy them both by providing them with appropriate data cubes for their analysis needs as long as source data is available. We can also argue that cost and time constrain may prevent the designer to do so but this is the nature of any project. 2) Goal-driven approach does not consider existing rationale nor structure, which could be accommodate from the Supply-driven. \/ Using the Goal Oriented approach, what will be the architecture or it doesn't matter ? This methodology only provides a framework for the designer to collect requirements early on, architectue is not the subject if the investigation as this atage. We still have to do the actual DW design after we have collected enough requirements. This paper does not propose a new DW structure, which has been extensively studied in the past. A dimensional structure in a DW can also be represented in an ER diagram, just as a 3NF  model. 3) How Goal-driven and Supply-Driven complement each other? Supply Driven analysis help us to discover availability of source data to satisfy decision makers' goal and Goal driven analysis discover the relevance of source data. 4) Not considering the existing DW environment and information structure. I would rather say this is a strong point of the methodology. It let the requirement engineer to decouple one-self from the existing structure. Of course we have to consider the existing structure when designing th ELT and BI applications, but as I have mentioned before, a clean and proper DW design will make ELT and BI application simpler. 5) My point is some organization remains using 3NF for DW and use star schema as the performance layer to improve the response time. Would using 3NF defeat the purpose of building a DW? The idea of using star\/snow flake structure is to reduce the lengthy and costly tables join statements on a huge DW containing 10s of years of global sales data.

Both 3NF and Cube provide values.  It is common to manage large Teradata warehouse use 3NF as base with star \/ cube to implement the performance layer.  Will IBM and Oracle perfer 3NF, I don't think so.  It is not about whether 3NF or Cube is better, it is what the DW product can perform better.  The job of DBA is supporting the environment, but not limiting the use - it is not an easy job and that's why they get their paid.  2. If you haven't see the conflicting requirement between stakeholder, you are lucky.  Conflict does not mean opposite, but simpily different.  For a 7\/24 organization, different department may have different definition of a day.  For a casino, the operator may say 04:00 - 03:59 because of the operation shift and cut-over.  Financial may say it should be 00:00 - 23:59.  It is nothing right or wrong, but different needs.  Another example is monthly cut-off, different department could have different cut-off date.  Building separate cube per department is not an effective approach. 3. About design and architecture, architecture should go first before design.  From your respond, I guess we may have different definition of design and architecture.  Architecture includes but not limited physical design.  Analyst collect the requirement, and then architecture.  When requirement and architecture completed and approved, it will go into design phase.

It is only a matter of which approach best fit the situations. In my experience, using 3NF in a data warehouse is rare due to the fact that 3NF requires more joins to obtain the data required. I am sure that there will be DW out there uses 3NF or 3NF+cube. 2) Yes, DBA is there to police the use of database. When a DB is used by multiple applications, there will be a need to avoid one application to monopolize the DB. When an application needs to do big complex joins, the performance of the database will be affected. These big and complex joins will usually be discouraged. 3) When a project involves more than one human being, there will be conflicting goals, agendas, and intentions. What I was trying to say was that within the context of DW project, there were no technically un-resolvable conflicting goals. Whether a solution is efficient or not is only a matter of perceived values, priorities and availability of resources. In your example, if both analysts have legitimate reasons, needs and demonstrated values to do analysis based on different cut off time, I do not see a problem of having two set of data cubes for the purposes.

Here is my attempt to response to your questions: 1) i* frame work - A detail explanation will become another presentation. I would like to quote from the i* web site the followings which outlined the most important concepts of this framework. The i* framework proposes an agent-oriented approach to requirements engineering centering on the intentional characteristics of the agent.  Agents attribute intentional properties (such as goals, beliefs, abilities, commitments) to each other and reason about strategic relationships.  Dependencies between agents give rise to opportunities as well as vulnerabilities.  Networks of dependencies are analyzed using a qualitative reasoning approach.  Agents consider alternative configurations of dependencies to assess their strategic positioning in a social context. The framework is used in contexts in which there are multiple parties (or autonomous units) with strategic interests which may be reinforcing or conflicting in relation to each other.  Examples of such contexts include: business process redesign, business redesign, information systems requirements engineering, analyzing the social embedding of information technology, and the design of agent-based software systems. The name i* (pronounced eye-star) refers to the concept of distributed intentionality. 2) What major differences are there for Facts analysis between decisional & organizational level? During organizational modelling, facts are recorded when an organizational goal is achieved. For example, a sales transaction is recorded when a sale is achieved. At Decisional level, facts will be mapped to the facts identified during organization modeling. An \"analyse sales amount\"  goal will have a sales transaction fact, which is then mapped to the Sales Transaction table onto the source database. 3) What are the types of set of measures can affect the Measure Analysis phase? This is just a discovery process which identify the measures associated to each fact, each fact will have a set of measures. For example, the analyse sales amount goal will have measures of \"total sales amount\" and \"average sales amount\". 4) I do not understand you question. Would you please elaborate.

If I correctly understood, in the presentation you observed that software industry is unable to meet the demand without scarifying the \u201Cquality\u201D and \u201Cfunctionality\u201D. If we reduce the quality, we would get a software component with lower quality but still incorporating and supporting all the requirements. However, if we reduce the functionality then we probably would not develop or get the product according to the requirements specifications.

I would argue that in most projects, with obvious exceptions, costs are closely controlled and it is more likely that quality would be reduced in some form or another before costs were allowed to increase. Therefore an adjustment to quality would be necessary. The term quality refers to many aspects of project management and in this case software development. My comments were speaking directly to two aspects of product quality; reliability and functionality. Certainly rushing a product to market would likely involve the taking of short-cuts like software testing. The obvious consequences of this action being the possibility of software bugs remaining undetected. The extent to which the project met the design parameters and requirements, as defined by the software engineer and stakeholders, could severely impact the quality of the product produced. As component selection is fundamental to the effectiveness of CBD it is essential that the stakeholder requirements be matched to available components. If a complete match cannot be found then it may be necessary to negotiate with the stakeholders in order to adjust the requirements. To speak to your comment directly, the degree to which the requirements must change would depend on what functionality would be lost. This would obviously vary from project to project and at some point the product could be considered different. With the term \u201Cdifferent\u201D, being subjective and highly interpretative. The articles authors also agree that more researched is required in the area of requirements negotiation. Such research may assist in the definition of criteria for selecting candidate requirements which can be negotiated without drastically affecting the end product.  I hope this addressed your question, Mario","courseId":119,"phaseId":4,"postId":35005,"postCreationTime":1201186277,"courseCategoryId":8,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/08 Archive","postParentId":34994,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d304ce6"},"forumId":720,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":12702,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W08","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 Presentation: Survey of component-based software development","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/08 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 Presentation: Survey of component-based software development"},{"postUserId":1352,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Thanks Mario for detailed reply.

Your first point seems to address some of the concerns that Liaqat had mentioned earlier. It certainly seems that at some point during the component selection process there should be a feasibility consideration made. If there are not enough components available, or those that are significantly detract from the stakeholder goals, one should consider whether Component-Base design is appropriate for the situation. Yes, components could be made in-house, however this does detract from some of the benefits of CBD. Did you find that you were faced with a situation where the components, or lack of, significantly impacted the projects ability to meet the stakeholder requirements? As to you other points, I would certainly agree with you. Component based-design practices shouldn\u2019t be an all or nothing affair. Especially in certain application domains there just doesn\u2019t exist enough components to make this feasible. Ensuring that the most challenging and resource intensive components are developed, and supported elsewhere, can make good economic sense.

Coming from an education background, I am well aware and have used the notion of partnered work to help students learn. I think your article discusses a natural application of this principle. One question I have, why do you recommend limiting the pairing of people to just junior people? An interesting concept I was introduced to was that the most experienced people are the ones who should be paired (or observed) most often. They have the most to share, and perhaps would themselves be buoyed by interaction with their juniors\/peers.

An alternative approach may be to take the user specifications to the best of the ability of those gathering requirements and then build a prototype for user preview.

My point of view is that software needs to be usable to have value and that the earlier necessary complex features are included in the system the less likelihood of overruns or unacceptable products. The authors have shown that having software technologists use a specific pattern significantly increases the likelihood that specific features should be built into the software to make it more usable. Knowing this earlier in the process what questions to ask and recording the value the stakeholders place on a feature just makes it easier to design and build quality software. I've liked using iterative processes as you describe, however I don't believe we should ignore process improvement tools that can be integrated into the process to build better software. I believe the patterns and questionnaires described by the author's are some of these tools.

The anecdotal data described in the paper indicated that participants were misled by a compile-time error message. Specifically, the error message: \u201CCannot instantiate the type SSLSocket\u201D led participants to believe that they didn\u2019t import the class correctly or they had to find a concrete subclass. As participants spent a significant amount of time trying to deal with this, it (in my opinion) caused the factory approach to appear much less usable than it probably is. As half the participants weren\u2019t familiar with the factory pattern, they essentially had to learn the concept during the experiment. A documentation strategy that might serve the factory condition to put it on a level baseline with constructors, would be to anticipate the errors that users would get (for example, the error indicated above) and explicitly show the object creational options for the SSLSocket class. So in addition to the above error, a list of methods that could be used to create an SSLSocket object, could be listed. I appreciate that creating such a compiler (or add-on) with this feature is not practical, but having this feature added in some way for the experiment would help toward really assessing the usability of the factory pattern and not assessing the documentation as well. In the above paragraph, I am referring to a documentation strategy for this experiment, but it would be interesting to investigate improvements to documentation by measuring different types of documentation on API usability. A brief search didn\u2019t reveal any research specifically measuring the effects of documentation strategy on API usability, but some papers (including this one) identify specific problems that arise from documentation.

Point 1 I think the range of skill level is reasonable as APIs are used with programmers with a wide range of skill levels. Having said that, I think a minimum skill level is important, and I get the impression that the authors felt the same way as they did do some pre-screening of participants. I\u2019ve seen many students with a year or two of Java programming experience handle and adapt to advanced concepts, so I am not that concerned, provided the pre-screening process took care of this. The authors didn\u2019t provide any type of handicap. Point 2 There was actually a factory component in each task. It was explicit in 4 of the tasks and implicit in the Notepad Email task. I agree, SSL programming can be complicated and the web of classes can be confusing. The authors just required that an SSLSocket and MulticastSocket be created with the proper configuration to connect to a specified server, so the participants didn\u2019t have to do much more than create the objects.

Nice work. :-) Based on my experience as a software engineer, I have found the factory pattern to be extremely useful, but that it's generic form is deeply rooted in the structure of Java. I learned Java in my undergrad and re-familiarized myself with it in this program, but work as a Python developer. Python takes a somewhat different approach to classes and instantiation than Java and as such I have applied (what I thought of as) the factory pattern in Python in a manner that doesn't align with some of the characteristics you outline. My approach has been to implement \"the factory\" in an overloaded constructor of the parent class so that it returns instances of different child classes depending on the aruguments passed to it. I don't recall if Java constructors explicitly or implicitly return an object instance, and if that object must be an instance of the class whose constructor is calling it. Python does not have abstract classes or interfaces, but it seems that my method has been analogous to calling getDefault() in your examples. Do you think this is a naturatl application of the pattern to the constrains of a different language, or am I doing something that is not in fact the factory pattern? Also, do you think that this adaptation of building the factory into the constructor might improve the learning and adoption curve for this pattern?","courseId":119,"phaseId":4,"postId":35071,"postCreationTime":1201370300,"courseCategoryId":8,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/08 Archive","postParentId":34541,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d305a84"},"forumId":720,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":12620,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W08","disagreement":true,"postTitle":"Re: TME 1 Presentation - Factory Pattern Usability","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/08 Archives","topicName":"TME 1 Presentation - Factory Pattern Usability"},{"postUserId":1341,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Ross, Thanks for the insights.

The non-constructor method (the factory method) would call the constructor, thereby creating the object. This method would return the object to the code that called invoked it. There are several incantations of this pattern, but here is some code from Wikipedia that demonstrates what the factory pattern is: Source: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Factory_method_pattern#Descriptive_names class Complex\r\n{\r\n public static Complex fromCartesian(double real, double imag) {\r\n return new Complex(real, imag);\r\n }\r\n\r\n public static Complex fromPolar(double modulus, double angle) {\r\n return new Complex(modulus * cos(angle), modulus * sin(angle));\r\n }\r\n\r\n private Complex(double a, double b) {\r\n \/\/...\r\n }\r\n}\r\n Notice that the constructor is private, meaning no method can directly call it. But, objects from the Complex class can still be created by calling one of the two factory methods fromCartesian() or fromPolar(). This is the general idea. If someone wanted to create a Complex object they would use a statement like this: Complex x = Complex.fromCartesian(7.1, 3.4); The object is being \"created\" by the factory and not from a constructor (directly). A common application of the factory pattern is to solve the so-called singleton problem. Suppose that you create a class that can have only one instance. How would you prevent users from creating instances of the class by just invoking the constructor whenever they wanted? If you only provide a public factory method, then you can test to see if the constructor was previously called by holding on to a static reference to the original instance, and testing to see if that reference is null). In this case, the factory method would always (other than the first time) return a reference to the original object.

The model seems very linear: BUSINESS => ARCHITECTURE => PROCESS => ORGANIZATION I read the article and a line that caught my attention (paraphrasing) \"Ideally the entities at the right side of the BAPO acronym should be driven by the left EVEN though this does not always work in practice\" (emphasis mine) The above statement reminds me of the classic waterfall model which is usually not well suited for projects of large complexity (in fact maybe the quote should read 'does not OFTEN work in practice). It looks like the BAPO model tried to address this in the ARCHITECTURE phase: CUSTOMER <==> APPLICATION <==> FUNCTIONAL VIEW <==> CONCEPTUAL <==> REALIZATION The iterative approach happens here where the functional view is supposed to try to harmonize the commercial views (customer and application) with the technical views (conceptual and realization). However, this iterative refinement occurs in the ARCHITECTURE phase which is the second phase of the BAPO model which implies to me from the first quote that the BUSINESS context phase is not refinable? What happens in the business context phase? Is it something that can't be changed and thus \"set in stone\" or is it something of this particular model in which it does not want to allow any iterative refinement in the BUSINESS phase?

Four aspects can be identified which influence the evaluation in the business dimension: Identity: how well has the organization formulated an identity relating to the family products it offers Vision \u2013 how well does the organization aims for a future where the family products fit Objectives \u2013 how well does the organization determine its future goals Strategic Planning \u2013 how well does the organization plan the family They are organized in level structure: Reactive, Extrapolate, and Proactive Level 1, Reactive Identity: Implicit Vision: short term (cash flow) Objectives: missing Strategic Planning: missing In this basic level, there is no vision, objectives and business planning process to support the product family development, therefore decision are based strictly on opportunistic reasons. Due to the this reason, there is no expectation that architecture will reflect them, resulting in many ad hoc decisions in the architecture design. Level 2, Extrapolate Identity: identified Vision: medium term Objectives: qualitative Strategic planning: ad hoc process In this level, planning for the product family is available; scoping is preformed to determine the borders of the family and roadmaps are used to plan the development of the family. The architecture should be able to reflect the business vision and the objectives, also providing feedback towards the strategic planning process. Level 3, Proactive Identity: managed Vision: long term Objectives: quantitative Strategic Planning: institutionalized process At this level, decisions are based on quantitative cost models, scoping based upon expectations on the return of investment of the product family development effort. The business aspects give direction to the architecture planning.

The backlog drives the workflow, helping the architects determine what to do next. It is not an externally visible, persistent artifact; on small projects it may only be a list in the architect\u2019s notebook, while for larger projects it might be an electronic, shared spreadsheet. The backlog is constantly fed by (a) selecting some architectural concern and\/or ASR from architectural analysis, (b) negative feedback in the form of issues or problems arising from architectural evaluation, and to a lesser extent, (c) ideas from the architect\u2019s experience, discussions, readings, etc. Once a backlog item (or a small set of backlog items) is picked by the architects, they will proceed to incrementally perform architectural synthesis, making some design decisions and integrating them with the existing set of design decisions. Thus the front of the backlog serves to set the objectives for a particular iteration of architectural synthesis. Less frequently, backlog items will drive architectural analysis or architectural evaluation. Once resolved in any way (issues resolved, idea explored, requirement satisfied, risk removed, etc.), the item is removed from the backlog, and the architects proceed to the next one. If they encounter some difficulty or some input is missing, the item is returned to the backlog.

I found your slides well laid out, but clipping in the audio made it difficult to hear your narration at times. Probably a result of the conversion process more than anything else. :-) In your presentation you listed one of the problems of Architecture Design as the trend for individual architects to develop their own architectural design to meet their own needs. I think it is obvious that this is a fairly serious problem which will affect the success of projects and repeatibility of results, but I'm not sure I understood the author's conclusions in this regard. Were the author's proposing a method for evaluating architectural design methods, or were they more advocating a meta-method that allows the architect to incorporate elements from different designs as needed.

Is TDD approach suitable for any type application or its suits well to some specific application domain? TDD is difficult to apply in certain type of applications, for example, complex GUI applications. But it is not impossible though. The GUI should be designed in a way to allow automated tests. A common practice is to use a Model View Controller design pattern, combined with Mock Objects. For GUI applications using Java Swing, Ruiz and Price have several recommendations and practices that can simplify test-driven GUI development. There are some research on techniques to produce fully tested GUI applications using TDD. For example, Presenter First is a technique for organizing source code and development activities to produce fully tested GUI applications using TDD. Ruiz, Alex; Price, Yvonne Wang (2007), \"Test-Driven GUI Development with TestNG and Abbot\", IEEE Software 24, 3, 51-57. DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/MS.2007.92 Alles, M.; Crosby, D.; Harleton, B.; Pattison, G.; Erickson, C.; Marsiglia, M.; Stienstra, C. (2006), \"Presenter First: organizing complex GUI applications for test-driven development\", Proceedings of AGILE 2006 Conference, 23-28. DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/AGILE.2006.43 Also TDD would not be suitable for legacy systems with no or lack of support for automated tests. In this case, even testing after code (TAC) would be impractical. These systems would require major re-architecture and refactoring in order to enable them for automated unit tests. TDD is suitable for component based systems that can be broken down into manageable testable chunks. Does TDD suit to small projects or it can scale up to any size of projects? TDD suits to small projects, being great at detailed specification and validation, but it doesn't scale to address higher level business process and architectural issues. There is a new article in the Dr. Dobb's magazine of this month discussing how to scale TDD. The author states that TDD doesn't scale by itself, and you need to apply other techniques to address concerns that TDD doesn't cover. He suggests to apply Agile Model-Driven Development (AMDD) to address the high-level specification issues that TDD doesn't, and to use an independent test team working with the development team to address the testing concerns that TDD doesn't. Ambler, Scott W. (2008), \"Scaling Test-Driven Development\", Dr. Dobb's Magazine, January 2008. Retrieved from http:\/\/www.ddj.com\/architect\/205207998 Does TDD requires collaboration in team environment? If so, then how well TDD suits to global software development environment? I think TDD itself does not require additional ways of collaboration when compared to testing after code (TAC). Sangwan and LaPlante say that the main challenge for geographically distributed development is continuous integration and testing. These activities are already difficult with traditional integration testing techniques, but they become a serious problem for TDD. Sangwan, R.S.; LaPlante, P.A.

The authors did not comment on the ease\/difficulty of learning the TDD approach. I think that learning the TDD concept itself is very easy. In the experiment, the participants were able to learn the concept during the session training on the first day. However, it will take much more time to be fluent in applying TDD. Usually, the TDD documentation uses very simple text book problems, such as a simple container, a money class, etc. The documentation describes very well these problems, but they don't help developers to deal with complex problems. And complex problems are what they will face on their daily jobs. Another factor is the time to develop the skill to write the correct set of tests at the right level of granularity. Writing one test is simple, but writing the right set of tests to fully cover the code will require lots of practice. So, being able to apply TDD in real world problems and applying it effectively takes time. I heard from some people using TDD that it could take about a year to be fluent in TDD techniques.

Lastly, on other study of TDD, it has been discussed that, one of the biggest challenges of adopting Test Driven Development (TDD) surprisingly is not technical. Instead it is often the psychological challenges that cause TDD to be used poorly or not adopted at all. For developers, writing in a TDD style can be akin to signing their name with the wrong hand. While it is certainly possible to make the signature look the same, it takes more time and concentration because it just feels unnatural. Furthermore, the idea of writing test code in order to exercise production code is already strange enough for most developers.

Bellow are the answers to your questions. Are there any advantages or disadvantages for a single programmer when switching from a traditional development process to TDD?There are many advantages for a single developer using TDD: Focus on the requirement: When you write the test first, you will be focused on the expected behavior of the system rather than its implementation. This is actually a good test for the programmer to know if they fully understand the requirement. If you cannot define the tests, then the requirement is not well defined. Exercise design at the early stages of the process. By writing the test first, the programmer can evaluate the proposed design to see if it makes sense before fully implementing. When writing the test first, you might conclude that the proposed design is not suitable. So, change the design now is fine since it has not been implemented yet. This is what I call \"tasting your own food before cooking it\". If the food will not taste good, why waste my time cooking it. Repeatability: Every time you run the tests, it will retest everything again. Ideally, all tests should be executed automatically after every build, using continuous integration. Refactoring: With an automated test suite, the programmer is able to refactor existing code and verify if it is breaking any current functionality by rerunning all the tests. Reliability: programmer produce a cleaner and fully tested code which makes him\/her reliable among team members. Organic Design Growth: You start solving simple problems and complexity increases after each iteration. You don't try to design everything at once, instead you will start from the simplest task and increase the complexity gradually. Does TDD increase the programmer productivity?According to the authors of the paper, there is statistical evidence that TDD is more time consuming, so it is less productive. However, the authors believe that programmers would end up designing more precise and accurate tests. According to TDD documentation, TDD increases programmer productivity by taking small and safe steps during development. Although more time is spent writing tests, programmers spent less time debugging existing code and design flaws can be determined sooner than later. Study about the biggest challenges of adopting TDD I think that there is a big mindset change for the developers. In the past, developers didn't have too much focus on testing while they were at school. There were no test frameworks available, and everything was tested manually. Today, schools are focusing also in testing. In our program for example, COMP501 requires that you implement your code and also a test plan. COMP695 has an unit that covers TDD. Recent software design topics help designing component based systems that can be broken down into manageable testable pieces. The XUnit family of testing frameworks (JUnit, NUnit, etc.) are easy to use and being widely adopted in the industry. Developers with many years of experience who still do manual tests, might think that it is strange or feel unnatural to write tests. From my personal experience, after working almost a decade with large C++ applications where writing automated unit tests were impossible, I felt really excited when I started writing unit tests using NUnit a couple of years ago. We were using testing after code (TAC), and I could see the benefits of automated unit tests right away. Today, I am starting using TDD and I would never work in a project where I cannot write automated unit tests for my code. Maybe developers should switch from manual tests to TAC first in order to get used to the test framework, and learn how to write good tests and test code with quality of production code. And then, switch from TAC to TDD. Janzen and Saiedian conducted a series of experiments regarding the acceptance of TDD. They conclude that developers are more likely to choose TDD after having tried it, and also that mature developers are much more willing to accept TDD than early programmers.

The organizing structure for sets of capabilities, remits and authorities is a role. The system has determined that there are particular agents that qualify to fulfil the role of the task but their authority level may preclude that as they do not have the authority that the role requires. A task process model when it is designed by the process model planner will be assigned an authority attribute. For example certain tasks may only be fulfilled by the 'chief-executive officer\u2019; others can be fulfilled by a 'project-manager', while others may be fulfilled by a 'mechanical designer'. Another possibility is a 'reader' role may fulfil the 'read academic paper role'. Authority roles work along the same lines as a business structure. The higher up you go in the structure the more that the manager may be allowed to do. This works the same in Task Based Process Management. In order to decide if a task should be assigned to a given agent the task manager will determine if the right attributes for authority are set. If so the task will be assigned. I hope this helps.

No the paper did not discuss the departure of a resource. However the way I think you would want to mitigate it would be to disable the resource. As a result the domain ontology controller would as a result disable all children that inherit from the key node which is the resource itself. The ontology structure starts at the resource and branches down into all the capabilities, authorities and the remit (UK expression for role) of the resource. So if the task manager is going to assign the resource to a task it would see that the high level node was disabled. It would have to be a rule to check this critical constraint.

How would you comment on this? No the authors did not consider the belief system as a factor in the study. The authors\u2019 main objective was to determine what the Vietnamese practitioners considered important factors when it came to establishing initial trust and factors important to maintaining that trust with clients. The reason was that the authors wanted to compare their results to the results of an earlier research conducted about trust factors among Indian practitioners. They used similar questions and similar format to that previous study. So they really focused on the perception without any regard to how the idea of trust in general is perceived in Vietnam or by Vietnamese culture. I think it would have been very useful had they considered what constitute as trusted relationship in Vietnam and then formed the questions based on that or added more questions to see how the practitioners opinions regarding trust was formed. To me it seems that the study is a bit inconclusive. If they were comparing practitioners in the same country but in different cities or regions, then yeah, there isn\u2019t a need to consider the belief system.   Secondly, one of your evaluations is that the interviewee\u2019s perception was not verified prior to the study? Can you please elaborate this observation? The authors didn\u2019t really elaborate on this point. What I think they meant is that they didn\u2019t verify the practitioner\u2019s perception against their opinion of the area of trust. I think it ties it to your first question. I think the authors meant that part of the limitation of their study was that they didn\u2019t verify what constitute trust in the Vietnamese culture. I hope this helps.

However from the article, I think the authors would like to consider the \"client's\" perception only in the same manner they did with the vendors without any mention or regard to the idea of third party's perception. And the reason I believe is because they want to compare the factors the client's consider important to the issue of trust to those of the vendor.

Here are the answers, In the Architecture centric approach, you mentioned that Quality Attribute Workshops are an integral part of the approach. Are these workshops regular workshops held by the developer\/s? Is it similar to code \/ software review sessions which are generally held in software firms? QAW's are little bit different than code review sessions. QAW is a facilitated method that engages system stakeholders early in the life cycle to discover the driving quality attributes of a software-intensive system. The QAW was developed to provide a way to identify important quality attributes and clarify system requirements before the software architecture has been created. In your answer to Bhasker\u2019s question, you mentioned that the system interfaces model gets fed into the process of connector specification process. I did not understand this. Can you please help me understand this? There are two different types of interfaces identified; system interfaces and business interfaces. System interfaces are at the boundary of a system. In the case of MSLite, one of the system interfaces is to the FSS (Filed System Simulator). Once the system interfaces are identified, the connector specification need to be developed to finalize the system interface definition. System interface definition drives the connector specification.

Please find the answers to your questions below. 1. When you presented the case study I was very interested in seeing it carried throughout the paper. I'm not sure that happened, or at least I didn't pick up on it. How does the case study fit in the paper? I agree with you, I have not carried out the case study through out the presentation, I did mentioned of some business goals of the MsLite and how integrated and architecture centric approach achieve some of its non-functional requirements . This is where I face the issue of what to include into the presentation and whats not so that I can fit the presentation into the time slice required. The paper actually runs through the process of generating the software architecture models for MSLite in all three processes, using OOAD, using Architecture centric and using integrated method. But for the allocated time period I couldn't fit in the processes and the detailed diagrams were not much clear in the video. 2. If you're able, can you expand\/clarify a bit on what MSLite is? I did a few google searches, and I think it stands for \"Management Station Lite\" - is that correct? yes thats correct, MSLite is the software that is being developed under Siemens Corporate research's Global studio project. The aim of the research effort is to better understanding of the issues surrounding and the impact of various practices in managing globally distributed software development projects. The globally distributed nature of the project makes it a perfect candidate to try this new process and see how the functional and non-functional requirements effects the system's architecture. 3. In your closing remarks you indicate that this approach is one of the most commonly used approaches in the software industry today.

There were three processes that were used in the industry today were identified in the paper. IBM's RUP , SEI\u2019s Attribute Driven Design and Siemens\u2019 Four Views. One of the processes that closely matches with this is IBM's RUP; Rational Unified process. The only weak point of RUP is that it relies on the use case analysis to identify architecturally significant non-functional requirements.

Can you please elaborate on the differences between RUP approach and the approach this paper is proposing? Unlike this approach, RUP relies on use case analysis for identifying architecturally significant non functional requirements. This approach uses QAWs to refine the business goals and identify non functional requirements, identify tactics to achieve them and rank the non-functional requirement. quality related information can be described along with use cases to capture certain system level quality attributes, but describing the properties needed to design the architecture of the system may be difficult with this approach. One example non-functional requirement of MSLite described in the paper is \"An improved COTS3 discrete event generator product is available for the system, and the system permits engineers to remove the old discrete event generator and incorporate the new one in less than two person-weeks.\" Expressing this requirement as a use case and elaborating into a system function is not straight forward. Another disadvantage of RUP is that, It treats the life cycle of a software system into four phases. Inception, elaboration, construction and transition. The baseline architecture is created during the elaboration phase at the beginning of which only small fraction of use cases have been analyzed. Identifying architecturally significant use cases when most of use cases aren't fully understood can certainly be challenging.

I've tried to read most of the posts so i hope i'm not repeating anything asked before. What is your take on the paper pointing out the need to integrate software architectures? Is it the limited attention given non-functional requirements in software design or to promote Siemens SFVM over IBM's Rational Unified? I only point this out since the case study dealt with Siemens own Global Studio Project. Also, the paper states the OOAD approach as valuable but flawed, and in the graphic for this 'integrated' approach, the processes for integration are the OOAD only flowing over to the Attribute driven design instead. Doesn't it seem wasteful to have two parallel processes with only one benefiting from those integrated processes of the other?

It was very clear and easy to follow.  I especially appreciated the periodic summaries after major sections were presented. That really helped me synthesize each part of the presentation together.  The walk through the architecture was extremely well done! For the examples provided in the results section, I assume those are results of UML diagrams that have gone through the conversion to Natural Language?  If so, did the paper provide the UML diagrams for those? Not having worked with UML diagrams extensively, I'd be very interested in seeing those. This is a very interesting area with huge implications as we move more towards globalization on all levels.  And English is such a complicated language, it's so fascinating that they're perfecting this at all. :) My question: This may be beyond the scope of this article, but how (if at all) do concepts like the below get handled? - Private vs. public vs. protected classes - data types (text, number, boolean, string etc...)

Thanks for your comments. UML Examples: the paper did not provide any examples of UML diagrams themselves. Some of the examples were from the paper, but a lot of them were examples I invented to illustrate the concept. In MSCIS you will (if not already) see UML in Comp689 and Comp602 (and probably others). I'd be happy to post examples I have (or e-mail them to you) if you are interested (jim.ronholm@gmail.com). Private vs. public vs. protected classes: the paper did not at all mention taking into account the access of various classes. It is my idea that these concepts would not be important when communicating back to the user, unless one took the tack that private entities were control structures that were not part of the specifications themselves. They did analyze the affect of stereotypes (like <<abstract>>), and I'll give you a quote that supports my guess above: \"When we generate NL speciﬁcations, we mainly take into account \u2018\u2018entity\u2019\u2019 classes as they are the ones that contain the information about the system being developed.\" Data types: again not mentioned, but also (IMO) not necessarily important for the abstract target. The intent of Natural Language is to remove implementation specific content and leave the reader with a more generalized (and readable) viewpoint. As an example, a user will be interested to know that a BankAccount class has a balance attribute, but s\/he will not care what data type is used to implement it.

The benefits would differ from project to project, it is even possible you would find a project with no faults in the specifications (sarcasm).

The authors rationale was simply that this was an academic exercise and academic sources would be \"acceptable\".

With respect to your last comment (about an NL description) I was surprised that they chose to test their system on a model that did NOT have such a description (but they used some other models present, such as the use cases to verify their results).

In this paper there was no formal method for generating rules. The authors simply looked at the actual forms found in the 45 samples and then wrote rules (by inspection) that matched the data. These rules were used to tag each word with a part of speech (PoS). The \"Fill Templates\" portion refers to the way they generate sentences from the individual words. For example one could use the template that a sentence will consist of a subject (N), followed by a verb (V), followed by an object (N). S->N, V, N. In the actual system there were separate templates based on whether they were generating a sentence concerning entities, a sentence concerning attributes, or a sentence concerning operations. They then \"filled\" the template with words extracted from the sample. A more concrete example: They may have used a template such as S->N has N for a sentence concerning attributes. The first N would be filled with the entity name, and the second with the attribute name.

If the motivation for your questions is to actually make use of the technique I'm afraid that the process is far from mature and the fact that the paper only documents a single test is one of my biggest criticisms. In this particular project they actually drew the UML model using their own system to test their algorithms, so if one was working from source code it would require a pretty good understanding of it before being able to test the system. However, presuming that work goes forward in this area the actual generation of the NL would be quite quick. Algorithmically it would run in linear time (based on the number of entities, attributes, operations and relations).

Actually since this system works from a diagram and generates English (as opposed to having to read it) it would not be bothered a lot by such things. For example, the same sounding words would not matter. If they were spelled differently then it would see them differently. As well, the general forms of the data would not leave room for many of these words (especially within the academic examples used). For example, I have a hard time imagining the word \"can't\" in an Entity name, relationship, attribute, or operation. However, if there was an ambiguous situation the system would probably still handle it well since it doesn't actually need to understand the text it generates itself. It only has to verify that it is grammatically correct by ensuring that the found word has the correct part of speech (ex. noun, verb, preposition) and that it is semantically correct. This second part would be for any meaning (i.e. if one meaning of the word did not fit semantically but another did, the word would be allowed). This system did not need human interaction, but some of the related work does. I definitely think the system needs to be tested on more models. Although the sentences that were generated were readable and did reflect the model, the fact that testing it on only one model and in that model discovering a new phrase form that they had not encountered before actually means that they have not yet had a fully successful test. It could be that the next ten tests will also discover new forms that have not yet been accounted for!

It was easy to listen to, easy to read, and easy to follow. Motivations, results, and conclusions, were all solidly presented and clear. The architecture walk-through was nicely done. Most of the questions I had you answered right in the presentation, including such things as how do you tie the UML to an implemented system to ensure that the NL specifications are actually being created from the implementation, and not some UML that might be stale. I too was wondering about whether or not there was anything to distinguish between public\/private methods and attributes. I guess this methodology doesn't need to distinguish between them and were it to be used in a real setting, it'd be up to the person generating the NL specification to decide whether to focus on the class interface, the class internals, or everything. I also was wondering about the vagueness and potential complexity of NL, but I think you spoke to that somewhat when it came to words with multiple meanings, etc. The only other thing that came to mind is how dependent the NL specifications are on the implemented code being broken out into discrete and meaningful chunks (since the methods are being used to generate the specification). I suppose that might be argument that they are primarily concerned with the interface and not the internals. It's probably been said, but with this sort of process being run on code during the implementation phase, it would probably have a tendency to keep naming and organization consistent, as you would could with the dependicies of a tool like GeNLangUML in mind. Okay, one other thing came to mind and that is how specifications make there way into much more than class and method names. There will be business logic coded right into publically exposed methods or hidden in private methods. And other logic can be hidden away in configuration. I'm not sure how all that fits into the context of generating NL specifications. It's definitely beyond the scope of this research as they were focused on UML Class Diagrams. Thanks, Jim.

However, some of the related work did need this type of additional effort. To avoid confusing different systems I will call the system to generate Natural Language as the NLS and the system being analysed as the TS (target system). One way domain info figures into the natural language generation is that a human (or at least something external) studies the TS before the NLS does. A dictionary-like reference is created consisting of words found (or likely to be found) within the TS (the domain). This data will then help the NLS to generate correct sentences. For example, if the TS was a financial system the reference might help the NLS to decide how to treat the word \"account\" depending on what other words are found in proximity. If the TS was a system that tracked system id's then the term account would have a totally different meaning - and it would be the responsibility of the person creating the \"additional info\" to make this distinction. The author's system had the benefit that they did not need to perform this additional work. Basically their rules allowed them to algorithmically decide how to use a word grammatically (after looking it up in WordNet) and then they again used WordNet to validate that the generated sentence made sense semantically.

There would have been no way to understand the terms if you had not explained it in the beginning. But I feel that in today's world, pair programming might not be in vogue, especially in the commercial world. The study says that the project is split amongst (driver and observer). But invariably the roles are toggled and reversed between modules. (This is what my experience has told me.) The benefits of this method you have mentioned are very true in the real world. This is very practical and I am sure it is being used continuously and extensively. For the drawbacks, I can say that I have experienced egos and intimidation to a great extent in the early phase of my career and at later phases as well. I have seen that developers do not like to share knowledge. They would rather \"do\" than teach a peer. They try to hold as much knowledge as possible to ensure that their importance is not lost at any point of time. I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed your presentation.

Although I have been hearing about it for some time, none of the \"code producing organizations\" around here (that I know of) are actually using this - but all encourage a more informal collaboration. In my experience I would have thought that pure individual programming is fairly rare. Even within the limited confines of the MSCIS it is fairly common for peers to review each other's code and suggest fixes\/improvements. Since I don't think that I would appreciate the more formal pair programming I wonder if there might still be something between individual and pair. Another point I wonder about is whether anyone has ever controlled for parallel work on different projects (tough to do). For example, five pairs might be quicker solving a single problem than 10 individuals working on the same problem. But could five pairs solve 50 problems faster than 10 individuals (with the same 50 problems) where there is no duplication in work (no problem gets solved more than once).

Expert-Expert"},{"postUserId":3821,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Anuja and Jim ... I have to say from personal experience, from when I used to do some coding (a long long time ago, now a days I spend most of my days dealing with network\/server issues) and from talking to some of the developers at my current work place that debugging does still seem to be a major issue. I mean I have seen deadlines being missed due to bad coding (filled with bugs). One recent example that comes to mind is a project that just wrapped up in the department (2008), it was originally scheduled to be completed in 2002 and lets not even get into the budget that was not in the same ballpark, it was not even in the same planet. Though I have to agree with Anuja that there are some good debugging tools out there, but we are still some ways away from the perfect tool, if we ever find one at all. As for which is more cost effective, extending the time line for one programmer or hiring two programmers. Well, I would have to say that it depends, how well versed the developers are in the particular field. If we are talking about two novice developers then it is most certainly more cost effective to have two developers since they would be able to, by continuously collaborating with each other, solve some of the more complicated problems. Now if the developer is an expert developer, you are right it would be more cost effective to perhaps just extend the time lines and allow more time for the project completion. I also do have to agree with you Jim that what actually goes on in most companies is not pair programming as described in the paper, since I find that most developers do not like to work in teams when they are actually coding but rather discuss the issues after they have finished writing their code. On your example of peer review within the confines of this program (MSCIS) the peer review is done after the code has been written, where as in the case of pair programming the peer review is done in real time as one is coding the other partner is reviewing the code, Also the fact remains that some developers might feel threatened by others whereas in the academic setting I find that there is more people who are willing to collaborate. Now, I am not suggesting that academic environments are not competitive or even the same types of insecurities do not take place in academia. But as a whole, I feel that since each serves a different purpose, most people will approach them differently as well. As far experimenting with different set of problems to see if the pair is more effective or not I have to say that in the case of Nosek\u2019s experiment the participants wrote only one program, where as in the case of experiments conducted by both Williams and nawrocki, participants wrote 4 different programs, as far as comparing the results of the experiments, I would have to say that the problems set presented by nawrocki\u2019s experiment as much simpler than that of Williams. In the case of william\u2019s experiment no detail of the programs that the participants were asked to write is given and I also did not have much success finding the details of the experiment (I am still looking online for more details on the four programs in this experiment) In Nawrocki\u2019s experiment the participants were asked to write programs for finding the mean and standard deviation of samples of numerical data, finding the linear regression parameters, counting the number of lines in a program and counting the total program LOC.

The forumula which calculates cost seem to include only SALARY * EFFORT I think that this formula is a little too generic... I mean, is there someone who puts the pairs together in a particular scenario? in a large programming organization where many pairs may exist, I would imagine a portion of cost must be associated to this and other tasks.

In large programming organization(s) the cost should be calculated per pair as they are working on selected modules; Also it is noteworthy to mention that the REAP is calculated as follows: REAP = (((Elapsed_Time_of_Pair) x 2 \u2013 (Elapsed_Time_of_individual))\/Elapsed_time_of_individual)  x 100% you are right Ed, 15 participants is perhaps not a large enough to make the results conclusive, however having said that I do believe that the script that the participants were asked to write were common enough to be able to draw some conclusions, since after having worked as a full time programmer for a while, most developers tend to solve the simpler problems in a similar fashion.

I agree with most of my colleagues here that it is difficult to find the business justification for pair-programming. The benefits as outlined in your slide are very qualitative in nature, or very difficult to assess objectively. The benefits in my mind still do not measure up for the cost of tying up two resources to do one particular task. That being said, I had two questions that I wanted to ask you: 1. Redundancy is a major issue within any type of organization. My particular company has the problem where we have 1 developer who is the only one who knows how to code something etc... Do you foresee pair programming to truly alleviate this problem? Or do you believe that there are better ways at ensuring redundancy in skills etc... 2. Would techniques such as code review \/ tech spec review be more cheaper alternatives to pair programming? Thanks!

Traditional software development methodology did not deal too well with change in software requirement(s) but extreme programming, while keeping quality in mind, deals with rapid changing of the requirements. In today\u2019s business world we see that most companies are changing the way they do business; the attitude of \u201Ctake it or leave it\u201D is becoming less common in the work place, more and more companies are willing to change the design on their product or service to accommodate the clients\u2019 needs. As a result of this customer service oriented approach, I would say that more companies are adopting extreme programming approach than ever before. One difference I have to pint out is that in pair programming, the participants should be in constant contact. There should be some sort of a dialogue between the pair at least every 45 to 60 seconds, which makes the peer review real time, but in reality we see that even though developers are collaborating it is mostly after they have finished developing an entire module. So what we see in the work force today is not proper extreme programming, according to its definition, but an attempt to approximate the methodology.

What contexts you think this may work? What I want say is that we can anticipate an increased used of agile methods such as pair program. and XP for the development of singular services offered to different parties. However, my question is then what about business process management in general, as sometimes it is not possible to have so high level of agility in enterprises where there are many intersection business processes. Today's methodologies for SOA development are primarily based on the principles for big BP enterprise scenarios, where there are different collaborating parties. In that particular context, I can hardly imagine that a choreography or orchestration of services will be so prone to the changes. Rather, certain services might be prone to the changes, and agility in that context might then mean rather how one can reflect changes of certain services on the overall BP where they are used. In that particular context, I can hardly imagine the use of SOAs, and yet also, I don't see that these reasons will also service provides to so easily change their already offered services due to the issues such as SLA and trust. Thus, the question is then - how to make a trade off between such issues vs. agile methods for SOA in particular and BPM in general? Any thoughts and possible contexts where actually agile methods may be more applicable and where they are less applicable.

Larger companies can no longer afford to simply rely on their reputation and perhaps use that as an excuse for not changing the way they do business on a day to day basis. In certain ways services economy and extreme programming can refer to the solution of the similar issue(s) as an example IBM traditionally has been known for manufacturing computers and later on peripherals however, in recent years we can that IBM is treating its business as a service. Although it still manufactures computers, it sees the physical goods produced as a small part of its business solution industry. I believe that the key is in finding the right balance, in every organisation there certain processes that form the core business process of that particular company. Those processes might not be very flexible; however all the rest of the processes can be modularized. Generally speaking agile programming techniques are good approaches for smaller companies that are located in the same location and for smaller applications that do not require distributed development. Applications that require a distributed development don't work well with Agile programming techniques. If you have some developers in Canada and others in another part of the world, team members can't communicate quickly enough. Distributed teams have difficulty getting all of the benefits of Agile methods, even though tools such as instant messaging or IRC may compensate somewhat. The system can quickly bog down, and you'll find yourself devoting a lot of time to keeping individual team members updated. Some companies simply don't adapt very well to agile programming techniques because they have a command-and-control management style. That kills the creative process required to make Agile programming work. Agile programming works best with modular programs that require a lot of smaller pieces that go together.

And now that I can see that its a relative number made up of both the individual elapsed time and the pair elapsed time, it makes sense.

In any case, it seems like further research needs to be done comparing solo to pair programming to flesh out the picture and get a better sense of that.

After reading the posts here, there seems some doubts about pair programming principle.  Before I give my 2 cents, I\u2019ll explain what my employment role is. I am a Systems Analyst\/Developer, which means on certain projects I act as an analyst and on certain projects I act as the developer \u2013 project leader decides which role I\u2019ll be playing based on expertise, experience factors and other magical things only known to management.  Most of the employees (programmers) hired within the last 5 years or so play this dual role. At one point I was told there were dedicated Developers and dedicated Analysts. Most of development done within the organization is done by pair programming principles. There would be an Analyst, whose job is to attend the various client meetings and create the specifications, impacts on the system, test cases and documentations. Then the developer would start coding the solution based on the Analyst\u2019s specs. From the time I\u2019ve started till now, I\u2019ve played both roles numerous times. And in my experience this method of programming works great, there has been times when I analyzed a solution which the programmer thought was inefficient and there were times when I\u2019ve asked the programmer to recode the solution because of its inefficiency and vice-versa with playing the programmer role. Initially, I had a hard time adapting to this way of programming because I was so used to managers just throwing a problem at me and I\u2019ll be doing the analysis myself then doing the programming. It was fine because I controlled the pace of the development, but there was a situation where I implemented a solution which didn\u2019t fit properly into the system, which I believe could\u2019ve been prevented if it was for pair programming. So, so far I am in favor of pair programming and from what I see around this organization when it comes to tackling a problem, \u201Ctwo head are better than one\u201D.

I have included your original message in my response and have formatted my response in red so that you can see where your text ends and mine begins. Thank you for your presentation. I found it very clear and easy to follow - considering that you had very little knowledge on the subject matter. I agree with you that the examples really helped in understanding the concepts. Kudos! Thanks. Now that you've had a chance to learn more about text mining in general and in particular about document ontology, what are your thoughts on using text mining for knowledge management - is it a feasible option for the average business or do you see it more specialized to certain disciplines? I don\u2019t know whether it is more or less feasible for the average business. I think that the techniques (such as the grammar rules used) would be slightly different depending on the context. For example, the authors of this paper were required to build in a number of custom grammar rules specific to the software domain. While these rules would not be necessary in a business setting (assuming that code\/document traceability was not required), other more business-like rules may be necessary such as accounting terminology, or stock market terminology, etc\u2026 Also, if you can, I'd love your thoughts on data mining (I view it as structured) vs. text mining (I view it as unstructured). I think data mining is structured simply because the source materials are structured, while the source material used in text mining is for the most part unstructured. At this point in time, it seems that text mining for legitimate information is a much more involved task that data mining. For example, to determine that a car is equipped with cruise control from a data mining perspective may just mean searching for the Boolean value associated with this property. However from a text mining approach the following text (or variations thereof) \u201Cthe car is equipped with cruise control\u201D would need to be located and analyzed to determine the same answer.

To make things easier on myself, I'll first comment on what's easy to comment on and that's the presentation itself (rather than the content). Since cosmetics did come up in the class's initial discussions of last year's presentations, I have a couple comments on that. On the whole, your presentation was quite easy to read. The text was slightly fuzzy in places, but compared to some of what I've seen, I think you did a great job. Audio was also clear. In terms of organization: I felt like I was swimming a bit up front, like I didn't have enough background or rounded out intro when it came to the material. I think I got a tad frightened by the slide at 0:00 which was titled \"Research Approach\" as it was one of the first things I saw. It has a small graphic to the right taken from the paper. And now that I look at it again, that's not really your 0:00, but must be just some artifact from the video processing on the SCIS Streaming Video Site, perhaps a bitmap\/icon borrowed from the video stream to represent the presentation? I can't explain it as your title page is clearly there in the channel selection area of the site. Long and short of it, I wouldn't worry about this. I saw that slide sooner than I should have; it actually shows up at 5:57. Your overall organization was solid. You introduced the paper well. Had a good roadmap to the presentation (overview). You made the authors' motivations clear. I didn't feel lost when it came through your walkthrough of the material, though I did have some more nitty-gritty technical questions. It was good how you tied the paper into the course near the end. Your personal reflections were also good and provided some context that helped me better understand the paper and how working with the material was for you. I did have a number of technical questions that came out of this. Most of the technologies they were using are unknown to me, so I have no deep sense of what they're about. I suppose I don't really need to know in order to have a good sense of the research or the authors' findings. Also, I'm not sure it's important for you, summarizing this paper to explain these things. If I want to know more I can go look them up myself. In any case, these are the technologies that I'd like to know more about: I have no real sense of what OWL-DL looks like or how it is used to represent an ontology. I'm not sure what JAPE is. I'm not sur what IR is (Information Retrieval techniques), though I got the sense that it had to do with analyzing text for phrases. Not sure if that's accurate or not. When it came to the actual research, I had the following questions: Is the Keyword based search mechanism parsing in-line comments within the source code? Or is it just parsing exernal software documents looking for semantic relationships that later are tied into the ontology coming out of source code parsing. I've seen some really badly commented code (comments copied from one method to another where the comments no longer applied to the new, radically modified method, and that sort of thing). It's probably difficult to really know what the impact of this would be on an ontology. I wonder if it would create relations that don't really exist and if their normalization techniques would be able to accommodate for that. I know there's only so much you can do and garbage in usually means garbage out. But it would be neat if it could realize there was garbage there due to inconsistencies in the relationships. Something else for future work, perhaps. It's odd, but I didn't get a solid sense of whether this research was considered successful or not. The results say that Text Mining alone did better than Text Mining with the Source Code Ontology added. I guess the results are summarized here, but I don't have a good sense of how those results fit into the context of work that has gone on before, if any, or how they compare to some idealized goal of what these technologies might achieve. When it comes to an idealized goal, I'm not even sure what that would look like, but I guess a baseline measure that could be used for comparison would be something created manually by a human being. That might be something else for future work though. Could they really not beef up their logic to somehow distinguish constructors from classes? I realize they're probably trying to keep their parsing generic, but it seems like there must be some way to do this without building in a lot of language-specific logic. I suppose something like this might be part of their future work suggestions. It's a very interesting subject. Thank you Laurie for your presentation.

The text was slightly fuzzy in places, but compared to some of what I've seen, I think you did a great job. Audio was also clear. I also found that some of the slides appeared a bit fuzzy once uploaded to the SCIS site. In AVI format the fonts were much crisper. I had followed the professor\u2019s suggestions in terms of using contrasting colors for the text and background as well as ensuring that I did not display any text in a font size below 20, yet the text still appeared a bit fuzzy. For those of you who still need to present, I will tell you that the font style that I used was Calibri, and so you may want to choose a font that is crisper for your presentations.

I saw that slide sooner than I should have; it actually shows up at 5:57. When I first uploaded the file, and then looked at the image presented, I was worried as well. I am not sure how the SCIS site chooses the thumbnail image, but in my case the image was not the title slide. Also, I wanted to include a bit of background information in my presentation along with a description of a preprocessing step which was used to initially parse the text. In fact I originally had a couple of slides containing definitions, terminology, etc\u2026 The first run through of my presentation was about 25 minutes and so I knew that I was going to need to remove some content. In the end, it was necessary to remove these background slides. I really struggled with this decision though. I was considering taking a hit in my overall mark for the sake of making the presentation clearer. But in the end, I decided to go for the sure thing and not exceed the time restriction. Your overall organization was solid. You introduced the paper well. Had a good roadmap to the presentation (overview). You made the authors' motivations clear. I didn't feel lost when it came through your walkthrough of the material, though I did have some more nitty-gritty technical questions.

Also, I'm not sure it's important for you, summarizing this paper to explain these things. If I want to know more I can go look them up myself. In any case, these are the technologies that I'd like to know more about: I have no real sense of what OWL-DL looks like or how it is used to represent an ontology. OWL-DL is the Web Ontology Language for Description Logic. It is intended to produce ontologies for use on the World Wide Web. OWL has been standardized by the W3C and as such has a reputable backing. Within an OWL ontology the data can be interpreted as classes that contain properties. Among these properties are assertions that relate the various classes to one another. Also included are constraints which limit the types of relationships among the various classes. I'm not sure what JAPE is. I wasn\u2019t sure what JAPE was either when I first read the paper. The authors describe JAPE as a \u201Cregular-expression-based language for writing grammars over annotation graphs, from which finite-state transducers are generated by a GATE [(General Architecture for Text Engineering)] component\u201D p. 6. I did a little Internet search on JAPE and found out that the name is an acronym for the Java Annotations Pattern Engine. JAPE is based on the Common Pattern Specification Language (CPSL). A JAPE Grammar rule is composed of two parts \u2013 the Left Hand Side (LHS) and the Right Hand Side (RHS). The LHS contains an expression which is to be matched to the input (token). The RHS describes the annotations that would be added to the TOKEN if the expression on the LHS produced a match. Below is an example: Rule: DollarAmount (({Token.kind == \u201CcontainsDigitAndComma\u201D}):number {Token.string == \u201Ccurrency\u201D}):whole Below is an example of the RHS corresponding to the above rule: :number.name = {rule = \u201CAmountInDollars\u201D} I'm not sure what IR is (Information Retrieval techniques), though I got the sense that it had to do with analyzing text for phrases. Not sure if that's accurate or not. Information Retrieval involves electronically searching through documents based on a specific information need. An internet search engine uses information retrieval techniques when a search string is provided to the search engine. When it came to the actual research, I had the following questions: Is the Keyword based search mechanism parsing in-line comments within the source code? Or is it just parsing external software documents looking for semantic relationships that later are tied into the ontology coming out of source code parsing. I had read the paper a few times to ensure that I understood this step and it seemed to me that the keyword based approach was looking only at the external software documents. It was only when the source code analysis took place that the source code was integrated with the results of the keyword based step as a way to verify the keyword based approach results. I've seen some really badly commented code (comments copied from one method to another where the comments no longer applied to the new, radically modified method, and that sort of thing). It's probably difficult to really know what the impact of this would be on an ontology. I wonder if it would create relations that don't really exist and if their normalization techniques would be able to accommodate for that. I know there's only so much you can do and garbage in usually means garbage out. But it would be neat if it could realize there was garbage there due to inconsistencies in the relationships. Something else for future work, perhaps. The paper did not go into any detail at all in terms how the source code ontology would be populated and this was something that I was curious about as well. The authors did refer the reader to another paper (Empowering software maintainers with semantic web technologies) which then referred the reader to another paper (An Ontology-based Approach for Traceability Recovery). This paper listed each of the possible concept names that could potentially be extracted from source code (such as package, class and field). Within this list was a concept name for \"comment\". This led me to believe that a comment could be detected \u2013 although the paper did not go into any detail as to what was done with a comment once detected. Nevertheless, if the comment could be detected, perhaps work could be done to determine whether the comment was consistent with the code. The authors did indicate that in the future they would like to work on detecting inconsistencies within and among software artifacts. Included in their list of artifacts was source code comments. So perhaps we will see another paper from this group of authors that would identify the \u201Cbad comments\u201D It's odd, but I didn't get a solid sense of whether this research was considered successful or not. The results say that Text Mining alone did better than Text Mining with the Source Code Ontology added. I guess the results are summarized here, but I don't have a good sense of how those results fit into the context of work that has gone on before, if any, or how they compare to some idealized goal of what these technologies might achieve. When it comes to an idealized goal, I'm not even sure what that would look like, but I guess a baseline measure that could be used for comparison would be something created manually by a human being. That might be something else for future work though. One thing that I was unable to elaborate on (due to time restrictions) was the fact that a manually created benchmark was used. The authors referred to this as the \u201CGold Standard\u201D. The Gold Standard would be achieved if the tests produced 100% results in each of the three metrics used. It is hard to say how the precision levels achieved in this system measure up against those used in different systems (using different techniques) because the benchmark in each of the systems differ \u2013 partly because the expectations differ in each system. In the discussion on related work, the authors seemed to indicate that this system was superior to other systems in a variery of ways. In my opinion, the results were reasonably successful, but this project certainly left the door open for further studies to improve on the results. Could they really not beef up their logic to somehow distinguish constructors from classes? I realize they're probably trying to keep their parsing generic, but it seems like there must be some way to do this without building in a lot of language-specific logic. I suppose something like this might be part of their future work suggestions. I agree. Given everything that the authors were able to achieve in this project, I found it a bit odd that they were unable to build in some sort of grammar rule that would be able to differentiate between a constructor and a class. Perhaps this is something that was overlooked in the initial design. The authors did not discuss this issue when making suggestions for future work, but it would certainly be something that could improve accuracy of their system. It's a very interesting subject.

I was a bit puzzled by this as well. The only area of evaluation that the authors elaborated on was the Named Entity Recognition Evaluation. Perhaps because this is the only evaluation in which the precision level dropped when the source code ontology was included. In terms of the other evaluations, for the most part, all that was provided in the paper were tables showing the results with and without the use of the source code ontology. The authors did point out that before each step in the evaluation process, they manually annotated the source documents (as a way of determining their standard from which to measure the results). I interpreted this as meaning that each phase was measured independent of the other phases and as such any incorrectly identified entities would not be passed from one phase of the evaluation process to the next.

Why? Is the code quality measured? Are the requirements traced to the actual code? How? The authors spoke to the maintenance issue only during the motivation component of the paper as well as when they described the architecture. Essentially they indicated that much time is spent looking up information about the application in the various documents associated with the software. This is especially true for programmers who were not involved in the initial development of the software and are therefore unfamiliar with things such as initial requirements of the system. If some sort of semantic link could be made between the source code and the associated documentation, the time spent searching for specific details could be reduced significantly - since the maintainer could simply look the information up via the Semantic Web client. Although the authors described this as a major motivator of the project, they focused their evaluation on the accuracy of their system rather than whether it met the needs described in their initial motivation.

I found the topic quite challenging to wrap my head around. At the same time, I find this subject matter extremely fascinating and I saw this TMA as an opportunity to learn about text mining. I am generalizing here, but typically IT professionals (like me) have strengths in math and science. In text mining, those skills are still important, but they must be combined with strong language skills. As I read the paper (several times), I found myself bouncing back and forth between the science of making it work, and the language rules that drive the system.

I think that both would certainly complement one another. Having the ability to move back and forth between computer-lingo and natural language will bridge the currently very large gap between developers and end users (as is the case in the paper that you had presented) \u2013 as well as among current and past developers (as is the case in the paper that I presented).  Having a system in place that could trace and\/or translate any component within the software development lifecycle would allow for all stakeholders to have a good sense of the system without requiring those stakeholders to: 1.  track down the required information 2.  obtain assistance in translating the information Obviously, much work still needs to be done to perfect these types of systems.  However, I believe that both of our papers provided leading edge approaches to their respective areas.

I dont believe I saw any analysis on how having an ontology which connects source code and documentation artifacts would actually reduce costs? I agree.  Reducing maintenance costs was a major motivating factor in this study, however the authors did not make this a measurable factor.  They focused on measuring their system for accuracy.  I would expect that when the system is at a point of greater accuracy, then a follow up study could take place that would then compare the productivity levels among programmers using this approach against those using a more traditional approach in terms of locating and interpreting the artifacts. 2. How would a human software maintainer actually use this information? i.e. from a practical perspective. Do you personally feel that this is something that will be used? I am a strong proponent of having some sort of central repository of information (my Type-A personality is creeping into this thread!).  Having one place to go to find the necessary information and then at the same time, having semantic links among the related documents and source code would be a time saver compared to looking these things up manually.  Of course, the time savings would be greater to new IT personnel who are unfamiliar with the architecture, design patterns, etc... employed on previous projects. 3.

I have included your original message in my response and have formatted my response in red so that you can see where your text ends and mine begins. Hi Laurie, this topic was new to me and quite complex but you presented it well. In terms of presentation your slides were well laid out and transitioned well. Your audio was fine and never noticed any fuzzy text that others mentioned. Thanks. Hopefully some of the questions that I have, were not asked: Since I have limited knowledge in this area I was wondering if the authors touched on altering the grammar rules? Further if they could alter some of the grammar rules could they modify it enough to make their research more valid (Just want your opinion really)? The ontologies were built in a hierarchical manner and when applying the JAPE grammar rules, the entire hierarchy was analyzed. According to the authors \u201Cthis significantly reduces the overhead for grammar development and testing\u201D p. 7. The authors opted for this route rather than creating an extensive list of grammar rules \u2013 although they did create some additional grammar rules for the purpose of the study. In my opinion, I think that in order to improve the results of the study, the grammar rules would need to be examined more closely. I think that the authors have a good foundation for this, but more work needs to be done to take into consideration the types of source documents used within the software domain.  You also mentioned in your personal reflections that the authors did not use other metrics only precision metric? Did the paper state the reason for not using the other metrics? What was your personal conclusion on this? The authors actually used all three metrics, but in the paper they had only elaborated on the precision metric. They did not indicate why they excluded the other results in their discussion. My guess is that the results using the precision metric were the most conclusive and thus worth mentioning in the paper. Finally you also mentioned the authors did not use automated ontology in their research, do you think this would have changed the results or increased the efficiency of their research? Actually, the ontologies used in this study were populated automatically. In the related research, I had indicated that in the related work the software ontologies were not populated automatically. I think for a project of this magnitude, manually populating the ontologies would not be an option. I think that manually populating the ontologies would kind of defeat the purpose of the study since the authors were trying to move toward a way of locating facts about software without having to search for it.

I have included your original message in my response and have formatted my response in red so that you can see where your text ends and mine begins. That was a real good presentation that was really easy to follow Thanks.   I have two related questions: 1. Given the ubiquity of web applications these days that are N-Tired... do you believe that there will be any room in the future for text mining not just source code such as java files, but files such as .JS, .JSP? Do you see any problems with trying to incorporate scripting languages, or programming languages, frameworks that are not so well structured? The source code ontology was not populated using text mining strategies in this study, but was populated by means of source code analysis. During the source code analysis concepts and relations were identified. The authors did not elaborate in any great detail about this step, but referred me to a previous study in which 3 of the 4 authors were involved. Here is what I think though. I think that it really does not matter what your source language is. I think that when developing the source code analysis system, one would just take into consideration the language-related nuances that are to be analyzed. Each word in the source code is separated from the rest and analyzed to determine what that word represents. So it would be in this analysis step that language specific rules would need to be inserted. Again that is only my opinion. This stuff is all quite new to me, but it just seems to me that is how it would work for other languages. 2. I always felt that comments and the code itself was the best form of documentation you could ever have. I agree. In my programming experience, the first documentation I would refer to was the comments \u2013 and hopefully the source code was commented well. Then if the comments weren\u2019t enough, I would go looking through the related software documents to find what I needed. Do you believe that there should be additional parsing at the comment level in order to provide more context around the terms that are found in the ontology? For example \"sort\" in comments might have a related word of \"algorithm\" as well as \"mergesort\" etc... would indicate that we are talking about a sorting algorithm. I think that a great deal of information could be gathered from the source code comments \u2013 provided that the source code was commented well and accurately. The source code parser in this study was able to recognize the comment character, but in this system text mining was not performed on the source code. Since comments are often written in quasi-natural language, text mining would be more worthwhile in evaluating the comments than the source code analysis used in this system. I would think that a possible future study could be one that would use the source code analysis for all non-commented source code followed by text mining techniques applied to the comments within the source code.  However, we have all seen source code that is not commented well and\/or source code with poorly maintained comments. Applying text mining against these sorts of comments could cause inaccurate information to be populated within the ontology.

I liked the \"Personal Reflections\" section in your presentation. I should take a leaf out of that. Thanks. I have one question, what exactly is text mining? In almost every formal definition of text mining, you will see some correlation to data mining (usually in the See Also... sections). Essentially text mining is the process of extracting information from large volumes of text. It involves separating the text into individual words, phrases and sentences. In this study the first step in text mining involved a preprocessing phase In this phase the document was separated into individual tokens based on white space and special characters. Part of Speech (POS) tags were then added to identify each token as either a noun, verb or adjective. A process called chunking was then applied to the text using the POS tags to identify noun phrases or verb groups. Unfortunately due to the time limitations I was unable to elaborate on this step in the presentation. Once the noun phrases and verb groups were identified, the authors were then able to proceed with the keyword and source code analysis approaches mentioned in the presentation.Laurie","courseId":143,"phaseId":2,"postId":42045,"postCreationTime":1222308436,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":42001,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d305fb8"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":14922,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: (Dipan) Laurie Cutrone - Text mining and software engineering: an integrated source code and document analysis approach","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Laurie Cutrone - Text mining and software engineering: an integrated source code and document analysis approach"},{"postUserId":1326,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Thank you.

I have included your original message in my response and have formatted my response in red so that you can see where your text ends and mine begins. I enjoyed listening to your presentation. The audio quality was really good - loud and crisp - I wonder how you achieved that? I used a headset that included a microphone (plantronics).  However, the microphone kept slipping down without me  noticing.  Every once in awhile I would notice so there were points in the presentation where the audio suddenly got a bit louder!!  What sort of cost and effort will be required to set up a text mining and source code analysis system (hardware, software, HR overheads, etc?). In terms of cost, it is all over the board.  There are some freeware\/shareware solutions for those on a limited budget.  For the non-free\/shareware, most options include educational pricing.  In a quick google search, I found prices ranging from free downloads to $154K for a commercial license.  I found a site which compares some of the text mining\/natural language processing software options: http:\/\/www.kdnuggets.com\/software\/text.html I took a look at one of the software products - TextQuest and the system requirements were as follows: operating system: MS-Windows 98 or better for correct sorting: WinXP, Win2000 RAM: 32 MB minimum hard disk space: 9 MB including sample files and manual languages of the program: English, German, Spanish (version 1.9 only)) planned: MacOS, Unicode, Linux, other unixes on request (e.g. HP-UX, AIX, Solaris)   source:  http:\/\/www.textquest.de\/eindex.html In terms of HR - I would expect that there would be some sort of learning curve involved in developing the expertise to use this sort of system... How useful will it be to a small or medium sized software development company and why? I guess this depends on your needs.  If a company regularly requires the outputs of text mining for analysis, maintenance, etc... purposes then this would be a useful investment - for small to medium companies one of the lesser expensive options may suffice.  However, if this is a one-time need, then perhaps contracting out the duties would be more cost effective.  Laurie ","courseId":143,"phaseId":2,"postId":42213,"postCreationTime":1222701659,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":42176,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d3002d7"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":14922,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Laurie Cutrone - Text mining and software engineering: an integrated source code and document analysis approach","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Laurie Cutrone - Text mining and software engineering: an integrated source code and document analysis approach"},{"postUserId":1964,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Laurie Your presentation was extremely well-done.

Wikis and Blogs are tools\/software used to manage information and\/or knowledge and are usually integrated into existing KM software (see my response to Laurie).  The general practice of KM is more organizational, and the focus is on the management of \"individual's knowledge\" (i.e. capturing of experiences, beliefts etc...) In terms of this paper, the three-tier KM scheme aims to provide a sound solution to ensuring we are able to access and manage that individual knowledge. They've based the paper on transitioning from innovation to enterprise systems to illustrate this scheme. Finally, they've indicated that software (whether it be simple things from Wikis\/Blogs or more specialized KM software) help with this process. I hope that answers  you question.

In terms of lack of documentation or no time for documentation,  I really think more of a push for software engineering practices have forced documentation upon us. I think our experiences with failed projects have really taught us the value of documentation. Also, educational systems now stress the importance of documentation, so the new generation of IS graduates will already with equipped with that thinking.  As far as CMMI. I assume you are refering to: Capability Maturity Model Integration?  I've never heard of it before now.  However, doing a simply search it seems to be yet another model for KM.  If you're well versed in CMMI, I'd love to hear more http:\/\/www.mitre.org\/tech\/km\/cmmi.html Thanks!

However, usually I don't see knowledge \"put away\" in a sense.  It's like taking your experience on project A done 5  years ago.  You still have and will likely need that experience to apply it to a similar project B you're working on today. I imagine knowledge is maintained within software systems so relationships between projects can be formed.   In terms of what the usage is currently, I can't give you a number as I have no idea.  However, I can bet my money that more organizations than not are using some form of KM software and the numbers are growing.  This primarily, I think, is driven by two factors: globalization and the number of retirees (threat of the loss of knowledge) in the next few years! :) I hope that has answered your questions.

Do they fit in the execution phase? Or do they touch on a number of phases? Also, I wonder if Knowledge is not Information is actually a completely true statement, or the best way of expressing the idea.

Also related to my response to Andrew, I think the three-tier KM scheme responds to the authors' motivations because of the idea of parallelling KM practices with current SDLC processes.  So, a typical scenerio could be that you're using a process with no KM.  A new employee comes and is not privy to knowledge because it was not caputred as part of the process. As a result, it increases the time it takes for them to gain the necessary knowledge around that project.  If KM was brought into the process, new employees would be privy to vital knowledge that likely will help with that 'latency of knowledge aquisition'.   In terms of sharing protocols.  I'm thinking that if KM was part of the process there would be no need to apply or worry about sharing protocols because the \"sharing\" or 'capturing' of knowledge would already be part of the process and as a result would have to be obtained.

I was thinking about it as an is relation (which got me into humans are mammals but a given mammal is not necessarily human territory) when it could also be looked at as a has relation, in which case it's okay to say information is not knowledge just like it's okay to say an arm is not a person or a kitchen is not a house. It is a fine point, and rather than getting mired in logic or semantics (as I seem to be), the important thing to keep in mind about it is that we're trying to make a distinction between terms that are often blurred in order to facilitate discussion in the field of Knowledge Management. It's important that the distinction be made in order to be able to think about this field in any meaningful way. I went and did a bit more googling and found some other interesting quotes to support you and Einstein: Arthur C. Clarke: It is vital to remember that information \u2014 in the sense of raw data \u2014 is not knowledge, that knowledge is not wisdom, and that wisdom is not foresight. But information is the first essential step to all of these. Frank Zappa: Information is not knowledge. Knowledge is not wisdom. Wisdom is not truth. Truth is not beauty. Beauty is not love. Love is not music. Music is THE BEST... I will defer to those who came before me.

For example, lets assume I have \"knowledge\" and someone else with more experience has \"knowledge\" in 2 similar areas, how would a system handle rating such knowledge? does it really inquire for experience?

I will try to answer it from the paper point of view and from my own experience. In fact, I believe that there are two questions: 1) \u201C I was wondering if the authors provided any sort of strategy to use when all parties use the \"hard negotiation strategy\". In these types of situations, does the author recommend some sort of third party intervention? \u201D Answer: The paper tries to define an environment of collaboration that makes conflict resolution easy by following a specific process. Part of the process is identifying each party goals and starting from these goals finding agreements. The paper states that: \u201CIn the hard strategy parties are seen as competitors that not necessarily want to arrive at a win-win situation. It can also be seen as an interaction of competing stakeholders, where conflicts are will occur inevitably.\u201D One extreme action\/possibility mentioned in the paper is even dropping out of negotiation if the goals of the stakeholders are so different. In the corporate world usually being aware that a \u201Chard negotiation\u201D is taking place allows stakeholders to try to change the situation either by demanding a change of negotiation style or by escalating to the initiative sponsor. Usually, there is a sponsor for each initiative and in case parties do not agree, the sponsor will have the final say. 2) \u201C Or did the author discuss ways in which a negotiation system such as EasyWinWin would assist in situations in which the parties simply cannot agree. \u201D Answer: In the Easywinwin case, win conditions are identified by a facilitator and they are the starting point of agreements. The facilitator plays a big role in Easywinwin and he is the key to reaching agreement. From my own experience, the most important thing is to understand the situation you are in. Being aware of the situation and your own goals (not necessary personal) allows you to take corrective action. I believe that each situation is different and being aware of common concepts allows you to take the proper action.

Do the others state any kind of bounded estimate for how long requirement negotiations are supposed to take place? Obviously this would need to be a function of the project size, but it seems that from the author's point of view, negotiations can go on forever until some sort of consensus is reached. The paper does not look at project phases, just how requirements negotiations are conducted. Requirements negotiations are heavy in the requirements phase, however some sort of requirements negotiation takes place up to project implementation and even after in case there are requirements clarifications after the implementation. 2. This question kind of relates to my topic, but do the author's mention anything about requirements negotiations through the life cycle of the project. Requirements continuously change, evolve and are discovered, are requirement negotiations an activity that is iteratively done? And if so (given question 1), isn't it costly in terms of project time and cost to have these types of negotiations? I believe the paper again is looking from a different perspective. There are multiple stakeholders to defining requirements regardless of iteration or situation. However, each stakeholder has different needs\/goals\/agenda in defining a specific requirement and from this stems the conflict. The paper is looking at how to conduct such a negotiation which can be part of a bigger project\/phase\/iteration. 3. I believe Laurie touched on this question before, but soft negotiation, hard negotiation and principled negotiation tactics. Should there be different types of negotiation tactics based on the type of people you are talking with i.e. internal dept vs outsourcing work ? I believe that negotiation depends on each situation, each situation is defined by people, environment and other factors ... all these dictate each stakeholder his own actions therefore what strategies they adopt. However, sometimes, some people have an affinity to a specific strategy or choosing a specific strategy in a specific situation. This can relate to your question that yes usually people have different strategies for different groups they interact with.","courseId":143,"phaseId":2,"postId":41798,"postCreationTime":1222013017,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":41737,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d305f82"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":14952,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: TMA 1 video presentation titled - Requirements Negotiation","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"TMA 1 video presentation titled - Requirements Negotiation"},{"postUserId":1310,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Aurel, Your presentation was clear and concise to describe the subject matter.

The only thing I'd like to know more about is what these software tools are actually able to do. I'm assuming you're able to put requirements into them, perhaps break them down and tag them with priorities, and maybe add relationship tags to show which requirements are exclusive of other requirements.

Ideally I had over 40 slides and elaborated extensively on few of the terms. I was very surprised at how difficult it was to avoid UMs, Gulps and pauses. Often I had to come up for air which later had to edit out of the video. I had a bit of a problem with the conversion as I am using the flawless wonder of Microsoft, Vista! But the final product seems to meet the requirements and due to some unavoidable audio issues in the conversion stage has got a bit of fun to it too.

I would have love to elaborate on how MDRE can be a great asset in A.I. research but was limited to 20 minutes and only had to elaborate on the paper at hand. I did have a hell of a time converting the presentation in regards to the audio, so where the 3rd last statement sounds open ended, it was not supposed to be. My intent was to point out fictional technology we see on the sci-fi channels are not too far out of reach. Not sure if you've ever seen \"Earth: Final Confilict\" serries or not. In this series the concept of a hand-held camera enable communication device which utilized a flexible screen which would role back into the device once a call was completed. This technology is just around the corner as flex display technology has been achived already. Same with good old \"StarTrek\" series and movies where handheld tablets were introduced when computer were the size of a room, now most of us can't leave home without them as they are integrated into most smart phones. As for the cost comparison you asked about; this paper did not provide any but let's consider it for a bit. Let's say you are a manager of a software maintenance team. On regular basis you are asked to maintain or develop custom packages for your clients. If the focus of the team was to develop packages for a particular application domain, such as data warehousing, only the first instance of Domain Modelling would incur a cost as you can use the same model for your future Program Models. That is all the developed packages will follow the same domain concepts, even though they may provide some additional capabilities to stand above other similar packages. This would make the cost of domain modelling very \"Relative\" as the cost lowers the more times you'd use the same domain model. I hope I've answered your question. Please feel free to bring up any other questions you may have. I appreciate your compliments on the package and am glad that it was of use to you.

The premise here was that Similar Projects have Similar resource requirements such as time. There are currently packages out there like Cocomo and Slim which provide this exact capability. It should be noted that the resource allocations derived in this fashion would only be an estimate, an educational estimate, yet an estimate since the time taken for each project is directly proportional to the skill level of the staff working on it. So, although we cannot draw an exact time requirement for a project, by assuming that all projects in such database are performed by professional experts, we can conclude that this derived time requirement is a best case scenario. Personally, I would rather have timing of projects by people of all walks of life and experience level so that the derived time requirements would be an average time requirement.

You definitely kept things interesting with your relaxed commentary of the slides and the elaboration you offered to complement what was written. As far as cosmetics go, it was easy to read, with the exception of the model charts, but there wasn't much you could do with that as they were dense slides, and they were what they were. The audio was clear but a bit clicky\/choppy for me here or there; that could be a transmission\/download issue on my end though. As far as your organization went, it was great how you defined the concepts and tools used in the paper. If I got at all lost in the presentation, it would have been during the ZBRENT example. I had to watch that part twice to get fully comfortable with what was going on; but that section is rather information dense, so that's probably understandable. I did have a few questions: There was a mention of \"Same Output\" being a goal of reverse engineering. I guess that's the same thing as Relative Thoroughness. I'm not clear on how you actually measure this. How can you tell if a reverse engineered program's outputs will always match the original program? I guess you can't and that's why there can never be a guarantee of complete thoroughness. I wonder how you go about putting together metrics for Relative Thoroughness, and what the resulting numbers actually mean. When it came to their actual example with ZBRENT, I had a good sense of what the example was all about and why they choose it as an application domain. I wasn't really clear on what their results were; how good did the reverse engineered application end up being. When it came to all adequacy, lucidity, and thoroughness, how did it measure up? How did they go about measuring those things? When it came to inputs to their MDRE process it sounded to me like they took source code from ZBRENT to construct the program model. Is source code a requirement? What if only a compiled program was available?--how would that impact the MDRE process? Thank you, Kevin.

I did originally have more slides, a set of which elaborated on ZBRENT, however had to take them out due to time restrictions while keeping as much as I could in the presentation. It is good to hear that you did go back and view the segment a couple of times to get clear, certainly shows interest in the subject. Let s move to your questions: \"Same Output\" means identical outputs regardless of the code resulting in them. The paper referred to thoroughness as \"relative\" with respect to the set of tests used to check output equivalencies. So, if the original program was to result in 4 when asked to multiply 2 by 2, and the new resulting program also resulted in 4 when asked the same thing, we have thoroughness, however, does it matter how the 2 programs derive to this answer? That is where relativity comes in! Exact measurements were not provided in the sense of actual numbers which is why adequacy criteria was presented as relative rather than absolute. The authors used ZBRENT as the original program and developed a new version using SLANG which provided identical output to that of ZBRENT with respect of finding the root of a real-valued function only. The authors actually did not use any ZBRENT source code according to the paper, but wrote their own code in the program model stage. The whole idea of Reverse Engineering is to understand code or remake a program for which code is not available. So, it really depends on the task at hand. If you are trying to make heads or tails of a foreign code, then you need the code. Otherwise, you can still re-engineer a program using the MDRE process. This is specially useful when using or trying to improve discontinued legacy software. All good questions! I hope I answered them adequately if not relatively!

Ooops! Thanks for the compliment. As for the statement which stuck in your head; The exact statements regarding Thoroughness and Lucidity in slide 14 (MDRE Process) were as follows: If the generated program gives identical results to the original program, then we have thoroughness. If domain concepts connect to all program constructs then we have lucidity. The exact comparison % is implied as 100% by the keyword \"identical\" with respect to results of the original and resulting programs. I agree with the authors as to MDRE would require some training with respect to modelling and modelling tools such as UML; however, I do share their thoughts on how MDRE's time and effort saving factors more than compensating for this drawback, as training is often a one time event for most professionals who will use the tools on frequent basis. Of the years I've found that even unknowingly I've used the methodology of modelling which has saved me tons of time and effort on a number of projects. MDRE is not only a tool for IT\/IS managers, but this paper's focus was its benefits for \"software maintenance\" managers. I'm sure other IT\/IS managers can benefit from the methodology by adapting it into their processes. MDRE inheritengly relates to Reverse Engineering, as it is a more specific method of reverse engineering. So yes, MDRE is an improvement to reverse engineering, however, I feel that the methodology of Modelling has many applications, specifically in research projects. Hope that answers your questions. I'll be happy to elaborate on anypoint. Thanks for your comments.

It took some work but not much technology. I used the CamStudio 2.5 beta on Vista for converting the transparencies and accompanying narrations. But to get the audio to go smoothly, I used a audio male-male\/patch cable to re-route the audio from the speakers to the line-in jacks. CamStudio took care of the rest. The recording was done using an old Creative Labs stick Mic from probably a decade ago. As for the video quality, I made sure the show was in 640x480 and set CamStudio to capture that region only rather than full screen and always selected the highest quality for both video and audio without any concern on the size of the final product. Lastly before posting, I did some editing to get rid of the last black screen of the show, and first part of the recording which was my mouse moving and starting the show. This was all saved as a WMV file and uploaded to the site leaving it for the server-side to convert it to FLV . But then not only 2mins from the tail end of the presentation was missing, but also, the quality of both audio and video was degraded considerably and I could not seek through the presentation. To solve this, I then converted the video to FLV; but what to use?!? Adobe offers a 30 day trial full edition download of its products so I went ahead and downloaded and installed. Then I used the Adobe Flash Video Encoder to convert the video to FLV. I was rather surprised at how quick it did the job and what great quality. It took a while to get to this process. In regards to your other questions, I must first point out that the paper was specifically focused on Model-Driven Reverse Engineering (MDRE) rather than Reverse Engineering (RE). Authors pointed out how RE itself is riddled with uncertainties and problems. The authors demonstrated that the Model-Driven approach to RE helps eliminate, if not only lower, many uncertainties faced with RE. Now, as for your questions, I will assume that you were referring to MDRE rather than RE. 1. This paper elaborated on adequacies, benefits and costs in relative terms rather than absolutes as pointed out in the presentation. Even though the authors provided the means to measure costs and efforts for MDRE, they began by pointing out the absence of standards of measuring RE due to lack means to measure costs and efforts in naked RE as a result of its extensive uncertainties. They did offer that relatively, MDRE would require would be associated to less cost and effort compared to RE as by introducing Models we can eliminate some cost and effort contributors without making new ones. 2. Good question. There would be a number of factors I'd have to consider depending on the organization. I feel that documentation must be mandatory. For my own team, I would have a standard minimum acceptable documentation process including both in-code documentation written for future developers and external companion documentation for professional users which later can be revamped for the average user. However, I must agree with the authors that software maintenance can easily involve 3rd party code where documentation is not placed in a high state of priority as I would place and as such reverse engineering is unavoidable. Having said that I have found MDRE to be a great asset when working with open source software. In my opinion, reverse engineering, model-driven or not, must include documentation as by definition it is \"the process of comprehending software and producing a model of it at a high abstraction level, suitable for documentation, maintenance, or re-engineering.\" But not including documentation in the RE project seems illogical since without documentation, all efforts may have to be repeated if the same product needs to be re-visited. Good questions! Hope that answers your questions.

I suspect they too had to abide by some restrictions when submitting their paper. I also suspect that both ZBRENT and SLANG are tools they are very familiar with, but that is only my impression. In regards to altering the program to change its intended behaviour, I must point out that MDRE is a tool to better understand how a program works rather than a tool to modify it. MDRE may also be used to re-engineer a program but such task would be based on the functionalities which the original program provides toward the goal of duplicating them. Now, that is not to say MDRE cannot be used, creatively, to change the code of a program to alter its intended results. I mean, once you know how the code works, you can change it in anyway you want, I can think of a few productive reasons for this, so it is possible; but that is not a unique ability to MDRE.

This goes a long way in my future presentation developments. As to your questions: 1) Let's take the following image as the representation of SDLC: I think it would be fair to say that MDRE, if not the methodology of modelling, can play a role within the Development stage of SDLC. I must however point out that even though this paper presented MDRE as a process of comprehending software for the purposes of documentation, maintenance and re-engineering, similar to SDLC, it is rather a methodology which can be utilized in any project. 2) This paper focused on MDRE's enabling of a software maintenance manager to better predict cost and effort only. However I can tell you from experience that the use of modelling has been a great asset to me in the both development and testing phases of projects I've worked on. So, it is my opinion that by adapting to the MDRE's methodology, an IT manager can not only better predict cost and effort of projects but also lower cost and effort of future product development or maintenance by each project. I hope I've covered the areas you were interested in. Feel free to elaborate on parts which I may have missed and I'll be happy to expand on them.

If I could tag onto Christian's comment I wondered about performance specifications. It would seem to me that there is an added dimension during software maintenance that is related to performance. As I implied in another thread, functional specifications often do not include, or at least give little importance towards performance. Often during the maintenance portion of the lifecycle the maintainers are on the hook to actually improve on the performance of the implemented system (Vista's SP1 comes top mind). Other times it is important for the maintainers to keep the system from degrading (as the data store grows for example). Was there any specific mention of performance specifications (for example they might be part of the original requirements or one of the test plans)?

I like your free-form style of presenting the material. I also like that you presented the slides without reading from a paper; it made the presentation more appealing to listen to. The information that software maintenance accounts for 90% of the total cost over the life of the software was new to me. My understanding was that costs were low during planning and maintenance phases and considerably higher during implementation. Another interesting point you bring up is about de-commissioning of information. When is the right time to do so? We must consider that there is a cost to keeping the information available: the cost of servers and infrastructure, overhead associated with writers and techies to maintain the docs, etc. Yet, removing information when it aides even a single search is not acceptable either.

Let me try and answer them as best I can from my limited experience: 1. Costs of software maintenance - I have been managing IT infrastructures for quite some time, in almost all instances, even when we take an off the shelf software like SAP (well not quite off the shelf but close), maintenance and support costs are easily 30% per year. Given a short 3 yr period you can see how this can overcome the initial costs of buying the system. 2. Decommisioning of information is a whole topic that I am sure papers have been written about. That is not really the issue being discussed. I would disagree with you about keeping the information even if one search is needed...the actual analysis should be cost vs. benefits.. in any scenario. If the costs of maintaining the documentation is higher than the total benefits expected, then dont do it. This would apply even more in the scenario you mention in terms of a small private company with limited resources.

Regarding the topic, I'm surprised at the results, too. You said it yourself though about the sample sizes being too small. I don't really understand why they'd have to be so small either. It would seem that you could easily get a large sample, a global one for that matter, over the Internet. Also, I'm having trouble with the breakdown: 26% managers, 63% analysts, 7% programmers, %4 consultants. I can't see that managers would ever look at source code or the comments inside. I know you were lumping analysts and programmers together, but I'd like to know how they were defining themselves. Maybe they do actually need to be lumped together just because there definitions weren't made clear in the survey. Maybe it would be important in a future survey to not only ask for a role, but ask some questions like how much time they work with various artifacts in a given week. (Perhaps if we had that information we'd know why they got the results they have. Maybe they polled a bunch of managers that spent 100% of their time poring over code! :o)) It seems to me that an analyst would be less worried about the specifics of a particular piece of code and the comments that describe its implementation. So it does seem like it should only be the 11% that care about source code comments. As that wasn't the case, you just have to wonder what was going on there.

I completely agree with your assessment. A larger sample should have been used. I think the breakdown the paper used (again my assessment) is that managers, particularly in lower levels, may actually do need documentation and most probably when an issue arises due to missing documentation or documentation work that needs to be managed, they would be aware as it may impact them directly. So, I think they present a valuable \"frame\" or perspective to the survey.

A presentation on Apriori algorithm can be found here:http:\/\/www-users.cs.umn.edu\/~kumar\/Presentation\/M7-dm-chap4.pdf Now suppose you have a finished project. You have data about defects already discovered in this project. You also have data about defects from past 200 projects. You know that all projects were performed under similar procedures, software is modular and it contains large number of standard logic and even components from past projects (code reuse). You take Apriori algorithm that has been trained on some historical data already and you give it data about known defects for your project. Apriori algorithm, based on past data will either not produce anything, or it will produce a list of possible defects that it has found by association with the defects you have already found. Then you go and check whether there are those actual defects. If you have a large programming project, at least it will point you towards potentially problematic areas and will save you resources of double-checking and triple-checking all of the source code. Now how effective Apriori algorithm will be in your case--you will have to discover for yourself as the study was done only on data obtained from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The methods by which the actual testing was performed On slide 4 I mention 6 types of defects that authors were looking for computational defect, data value defect, internal interface defect, external interface defect, initialization defect,logic\\control structure defect.

Authors did explicitly mention Naive Bayesian Algorithm (conditional probability based), C4.5 (well-known-tree) and PART (rule-based) algorithms. I have to state that authors have used software defect prediction as a possible application for ARM algorithm. Authors were using historic data so activity they were engaged in was essentially applied data mining. I have found this resource that microsoft uses on data mining : http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ms175595.aspx As far as commercial solutions go, this article http:\/\/www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk\/~norman\/papers\/ESPI%202005%20-%20Improved%20software%20defect%20prediction%20v2.pdf  mentions AgenaRisk software http:\/\/www.agenarisk.com\/ as containing software defect detection capability module. That being said it is unlikely that software analyzing and testing tools will have such capability because it is more of project manager's job to analyze historic defect rate and compare it to the product at hand than of quality assurance specialist. If based on prior experience you have such and such pattern of errors and now you produce a product with significantly lower number of defects than historically then either software development process was changed in which case historical data is no longer applicable or resources need to be devoted to quality assurance to find the missing defects based on histric data.

Author's motivation and Author's observation were mine as those were requirement sections of the presentation. In simple terms the minimum support value is how much system relies on its inductive abilities (transaction paths)that are used in establishing whether given item is a defect or not. at 0% support the result will be 100% because all of the rules are used. at 10% number of rules will be replaced with inductive paths so accuracy will decrease. Confidence sets the bar of proportion of defects to be identified correctly. So system will correctly identify 10% of defects with such confidence, 20% with such 30% with such and so on. The whole article is an attempt to prove that ARM method is more effective than other 3 methods which used to be industry standards back in 2006.

Thank you for viewing my presentation. This article was a case study of performance of Apriori algorithm on the data about defects from one company. Authors did mention types of defects, however they were the ones that NASA Nordstrom Space Centre has recorded. In other company most likely these types of defects would be different. That's why this article has limited use and idea in it should be tried on additional data sets from other companies. Market Basket Rule is the 'basic' idea behind the Association Relation Mining algorithm and further research needs to be done to establish whether this approach in defect detection is as successful as in the case presented in this article. Higher support levels will not increase prediction accuracy because as minimum support level grows, number of long, precise rules is decreased and system has to rely on its induction abilities which will never be better than the use of the rules because induction of the system will never be more precise than the original rules. Higher confidence levels imply the ammount of correct predictions made by the system and higher the confidence is, the less accurate system will be. So if you take all of the defects that system has discovered and then split them randomly into groups of 10 defects per group and then select 1 defect instance out of each group, the confidence level would be 10%.","courseId":143,"phaseId":2,"postId":42052,"postCreationTime":1222310375,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":41983,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d305fc9"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":14956,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Yevgeniy Gorbatenko--Software Defect Association Mining and Defect Correction Effort Prediction","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Yevgeniy Gorbatenko--Software Defect Association Mining and Defect Correction Effort Prediction"},{"postUserId":1964,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Deepak, Thank you for viewing my presentation. Minimum confidences are probability values that authors of the article have used to define level of certainty for bug defect prediction within their sample data. Confidence level of 10% suggests that for all defects that were there to be identifed by program at least 1 out of 10 will be identified correctly. Confidence level of 20% means 2 out of 10 and so on. As minimum confidence value is increased, accuracy rate of predictions drops because system does not predict ideally.

Yes there are formal definitions for minimal support and and minimal confidence in the paper as the nature of the paper is a bit technical I did not quote them explicitly within presentation but rather I have paraphrased them in slides 7 and 8 I believe. Minimum support was defined as the percentage of inductive rules generated by the system to find and correct potential bugs. Minimum confidence is defined as the probability of finding a fixed percentage of potential bugs. About NASA's method of running their software projects I may have mentioned in NASA software engineers may structure and plan their programs better than they code them. From the paper it cannot be determined what were specific project types analyzed. Projects might have been redundant in nature which may have skewed the study results. The purpose of this paper is to find another application for a certain data mining algorithm. I can't see it as being a starting point of any research because like I have mentioned in presentation, the data used in this study is too specific. All of your assumptions would be derived from studies that have very limited application. NASA Goddard Space Flight project data may not be the typical representation of common project.

In what ways are they different and are do have a sense of whether more organizations are leaning towards CMM certification than ISO certification? Second, I've got an interest in Knowledge Management. How do you see KM fit in CMM - if at all? Finally, just a clarification. Are the levels seperate levels of achievement or do they run in parallel e.g. can an organization adopt 3 out of the 4 levels depending on a project's or department's needs or is the goal to gradually make it to the Level 4 overall?.

The basic difference between CMM and ISO is that CMM is a way to communicate capabilities where as ISO is a way to communicate the process. CMM is a specific way of classifying an organisation's software development methods. It conveys how the quality of software designs are likely to be repeated. ISO procedures explain a definite development process. This, however, does not give an indication of the potential quality of the designs. Secondly, from what I know about Knowledge Management, it comprises of a range of practices used by organisations to identify, create, represent, distribute and enable adoption of what it knows. Since CMM deals with the maturity model which aids in identifying or understanding an organisation's process, it is possible to integrate Knowledge management into the CMM process. I have to admit that I am not an expert in this but if you are interested, I can look up some of the content I have referring to while researching for this presentation. Coming to your last question, organisations move between different levels once they achieve certain standards in the necessary processes. The \"certification\" process is a continious one and as we saw in the research, there is a lot of interleaving amongst the levels. The eventual goal of the organisation as such would be to move the entire organisation to a higher CMM level but this can be phased process which is the case in many of the commercial organisations.

It didn't seem like much of a surprise that there was a correlation between CMM level and IS implementation strategies. The one thing I didn't quite follow, and maybe you won't mind walking me through it, was how the data was analyzed when it came to coming up with the three \"CMM categories\". Did you feel that approach was reasonable? I wonder how well that categorization compares to what would actually be achieved in terms of CMM level after going through an actual CMMI process. I'm just doing a little reading on CMMI to better understand it. It sounds like you can't get a certification, but that you can be appraised. Is that a self-appraisel, or is there an objective body that does that? You did mention the demographics and sample size (212) of the survey. Did you feel this was reasonable?

You are right. The font on the slides was a little small. I did not realise since I was running the presentation in full screen mode and it looked fine. But once the window size got smaller, it made the font a little unreadable. Sorry for the inconvenience caused. Secondly, my commentary was out of sync with the slides. I assume it was to do with the software I was using to record. I tried it twice and both times, and both times this issue occurred. I am not sure what the reason was Coming to the merging of the CMM levels, a lot of the factors for the CMM levels were found to be overlapping. The researchers found that using three levels in place of five would be less confusing and easier to follow. That was the reason this cluster analysis was carried out. Also, according to various researches carried out, it was seen that some organisations classified as lower levels of maturity may still conduct some activities in higher levels. Therefore, the information obtained from the questionnaire on some maturity levels was used. It was found that a CMM II organisation had some activities in CMMIII or even CMM IV. Also, it was seen that organisations in CMM III or higher levels would have activities in lower levels. Hence a generalisation was made on the responses to the questionnaire and the organisations across the five levels were grouped into three. I personally feel that this would have compromised on a few aspects of the CMM levels defined. This is because the different CMM levels were defines with certain parameters in mind but clustering them would lead to a bit of compromising. Secondly, as you said the sample size was 212. Although the sample set consisted of persons who were very well aware of the software processes and were members of the software engineering institute, my view too is that this sample size was a little too small. CMMI doesn\u2019t provide certifications. The firms are audited and then placed into different levels based on the processes followed. It is a little different from ISO. Hope this helps.

Reusability is at the heart of domain engineering. Authors Suganthy and Chithralekha then tested whether the methodology used to build the reusable architecture and roles could be applied to a technology like web services. So the four phases of generating Domain Specific Software architecture, that is, domain engineering, creation of a reference architecture, validation of the reference architecture and application engineering were applied to the development of the web service to see if the methodology holds true. An evaluation of that web service showed that it does. In order to generate reusable software, it's necessary to build highly reusable software components from the start. Domain-Specific Software Architectures or DSSAs have been proposed as a methodology for breaking down large software systems into components that are very reusable within a particular application domain.

The statements you mention do appear to be contradictory at first glance. I think what the authors are trying to say - but haven't expressed too well - is that the methodology (including the four phases) are different, based on the fact that domain engineering is rarely used in conventional software development. It would be great if commonalities between applications were more frequently sought out to create reusable components. Modularity has come some way to helping on this. In this article, the authors are promoting domain engineering very strongly. Validation of the reference architecture phase is also dependant on domain engineering phase. Application engineering is done based on finding of domain engineering and reference architecture creation phases.

The idea is that agents are not necessarily invoked for a task, but are able to activate themselves as required.

An agent is defined in terms of behavior (or roles), in contrast to object which are expressed in terms of methods or attributes.

When they made their determination (in this case it is a \"proactive\" tool) they filled in the entry in their table of results.

I have found that through the years that merge tools where \"last person in wins\" is not a good thing. Merge tools to handle the \"Convergent\" changes are really a bit of a long term vision. As far as what changes would be addressed best under this taxonomy: I believe that their intent was to try to be as inclusive as possible in their scope.

I thought about that a lot during the entire work on the TMA. I recall a quote from the paper regarding characterizing changes. It was that a characterizing change was one that \"captured the essence of the change\". The definition for influencing was stated to be simply less than an essence (in a rather ethereal way). I agree with you that both \"characterizing\" and \"influencing\" seem to be on the same level as the other dimensions. I think that the subtleties of the distinction were at a more theoretical level than at the purely practical level of categorizing a change.

You can imagine the discussions we have (technology vs. pedagogy)! :)  The key part of their job is to measure the usability of components used in our online courses in effort to determine whether that component is an effective way to present content or tasks to learners.  It also gives them an indication of whether that component can be re-used in another course that may have similar needs.  This is especially important when designing software that caters to different learning styles and disabilities. In reality I find that 'usability measure' is often a missed or ignored part of any software development process - maybe because the number of tools that can automate this are low or it's not being engraved in the heads of budding software engineers.  I find a lot of us still use the trial and error method - I am definitely guilty of that. I find in my current job that it takes a looooooooong time to go through the process of measuring a component's use - albeit very beneficial.  Are you aware of any tools out there currently that automate this process?

I'm wondering about other aspects of usability. Meaningful naming is definitely helpful, as they speculated. I also think, since components are a bit of a black box, that it might be helpful when they're built in such a way that you can have a sense of what they're doing, if anything, and if they're failing, why that is. Too many times, I've wrestled with APIs, even with sample code in hand, and had them not behave as expected. If your inputs aren't reasonable, or if you're calling a method before other required process has been done, it'd be nice if you could be told somehow what the issue is and why it's failing.

I believe that it is possible the problem might be the criteria themselves.  But it depends on the target population, this paper were concentrated the usability of users and those users were software developer, not end users. These are additional interesting conclusions from the authors. The ratio of manual (HTML) files per functional elements (FE) have a good correlation (R = 0.93) explaining an 86% of the component usability. Basically, this means that the structure, organization, and navigability of the electronic manual pages (each page is stored in an HTML file) influences the component Usability. In particular, HTML pages should not be very long and should not contain too much information in order to improve that Usability. The number of words per method (analogously, the number of words per E) seems to explain well the component Learnability and Operability (R2 = 0.83). This is consistent with the intuitive idea that a component is easier to learn and operate if its manuals contain abundant information about its methods and FE. Only one derived measure (the ratio of return values per method) has some influence on the component Understandability, although without any major statistical significance (R = 0.82, R2 = 0.67). None of base measures are representative, being the highest value R = 0.68 for the number of HTML files of the manuals. Thank you for your comments.

I too am quite unfamiliar with reverse engineering, but became somewhat enlightened with your presentation.  My question relates to the potential future work in this area.  You had mentioned that work needed to be done in the area of \"cross-language application\".  I have worked in environments in which closed systems had been utilized, and in order to integrate with external supporting companies it was necessary to write small applications and\/or procedures usually in a different language.  So I was encouraged that this was an area of interest for future work.   Do you know how reverse engineering cross-language applications is currently being handled?   My guess would be that separate RE processes would need to be implemented for the various language specific components and then the results some how integrated, but I don't know if this is possible..thoughts?

With regards to your question, I followed the reference trail to a paper called \"Extracting and Representing Cross-Language Dependencies in Diverse Software Systems\" (the DOI for it is: http:\/\/doi.ieeecomputersociety.org\/10.1109\/WCRE.2005.19). Your guess is right; they use individual extractors targeted at each source language build a repository of information pulled from the different sources link the sources together, finding the dependencies between entities Some other interesting facts out of this paper: They use a product called Source Navigator to to do the extraction. It is able to produce facts (for internal dependencies) in each source language. It's robust enough to handle some syntactic errors. The fact generation for dependencies across languages was done with their own algorithms. The export all the facts into GXL (Graph eXchange Language) which they say is: \"considered the standard format in reverse engineering, [allowing] the widespread use of the results in other existing reverse engineering tool\".

And I thought it was quite good. As it was primarily a survey of things done and what's being worked on now, it wasn't like there was any research to assess. The only thing that was really new in the paper were their ideas around the updated role for Reverse Engineering, with an increased focus on its use in Forward Engineering. Those ideas aren't really new either, as we've seen in some of the discussion we've had in the forum. What they have done is take a bunch of elements and consolidated it into a new picture\/definition of what the field could be. And I can't really find fault with that. They did have that section on the use of Reverse Engineering in web services, and I could see value there as well, though I wasn't sure if there would be value for everyone working with web services. As far as shortcomings go, I would have been happier if they'd spent a bit more time talking about the toolkits out there, how they work, how much of that technology has made it into commercial (or open source) applications or IDEs, what sort of technologies haven't evolved to that point yet. But they were probably trying to limit the size of the paper and keep it at a higher level. After all it was just a survey. This is rather embarassing, and I didn't notice this until last night, but this paper is on the required reading list for this course. We'll all have the opportunity to read it in a few weeks here. I think that probably also suggests there's a great deal of value to the paper as it was selected for this purpose.

That's not something they got into in this paper. It gets back to the limited view I had at the outset about how it was about taking binary executables and creating source code. Often times that practice can be done illegally to get at someone's IP. It can also be done legally by the owners of that IP when the source code has gotten lost somewhere along the way, which I've seen happen a few times now at different places. I bet a lot of us have. I guess that's one part of the picture. And then I guess there are circumstances where applications have been re-engineered from scratch, without peeking into their internals or having source code. (Though I suppose you could argue that's still reverse engineering, even though you're only using knowledge about the expected behaviour, inputs and outputs, of the application. You're still taking some sort of knowlege about the existing system, putting it through some sort of process to come up with salient facts to create a new view.) I'm not a lawyer, but I know sometimes it's okay to do that and sometimes it's not. And sometimes it might not really be okay legally, but the company holding the copyright might not enforce it because they see a value in the reverse engineering process. The thing that immediately comes to mind is the WINE project. They're rebuilding the core of Windows and exposing the same API using non-proprietory code. If Microsoft really wanted to go after them, could they? I honestly don't know. I guess it depends on whether the API itself can be owned or if it's really only the underlying code that's in that position. If anyone else in the class knows a bit more about copyright law, feel free to jump in. Chances are the API is like any other thing that has come out Microsoft and become some sort of standard, like RTF, Office doc formats, etc. It's considered part of the commons now.

Legality In the United States and many other countries, even if an artifact or process is protected by trade secrets, reverse-engineering the artifact or process is often lawful as long as it is obtained legitimately. Patents, on the other hand, need a public disclosure of an invention, and therefore patented items do not necessarily have to be reverse engineered to be studied. One common motivation of reverse engineers is to determine whether a competitor's product contains patent infringements or copyright infringements. Reverse engineering software or hardware systems which is done for the purposes of interoperability (for example, to support undocumented file formats or undocumented hardware peripherals), is mostly believed to be legal, though patent owners often contest this and attempt to stifle any reverse engineering of their products for any reason. \"...[W]here disassembly is the only way to gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law.\"[10]","courseId":143,"phaseId":2,"postId":42604,"postCreationTime":1223106777,"courseCategoryId":13,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/08 Archive","postParentId":42484,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306073"},"forumId":865,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":15084,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F08","postTitle":"Re: Grant McClure - New Frontiers of Reverse Engineering","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/08 Archives","topicName":"Grant McClure - New Frontiers of Reverse Engineering"},{"postUserId":1325,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Perhaps some are missing the fact that although disassembly is one method of reverse engineering there are many others - including the black box approach where input is fed in and the results are analyzed.

It's definitely interesting, and can be a concern in some cases of reverse engineering. I thought I'd flag one other thing. During this discussion I've been thinking about how little I know about Copyright and Trademarks. There is another consideration, at least in the US, and that is the DMCA. I was just reviewing a document called \"Anticircumvention under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Reverse Engineering: Recent Legal Developments\" and there are some interesting things in there about fair use when it comes to using reverse engineering. It sounds like if you reverse engineer something for functional purposes so you can interoperate with it, in all likelihood that would be fine. But if you do it to get at copyrighted elements, that's when you're in trouble. One example that I can recall in this area is DVD Jon who helped to release the workarond for DeCSS (allowing for the playing of DVDs in Linux, but also allowing people to bypass the security built into DVDs, and made way for all those companies that sell applications that copy DVDs to DVDR). I always thought DVD Jon was the one who did all the work, but now that I read more about it, it sounds like he was only involved in working on a GUI. It amazed me at the time when that 7 line Perl program made its way on to the Internet, and all the brohaha there was about ensure that websites didn't share the information; here's a Wired article from the time that shows a version of that code. Okay now I'm seriously digressing; most people out there are using Reverse Engineering methodologies for legitimate purposes. It's the rare case where someone is doing something that is questionable where they could end up butting heads with something like DMCA legislation. (I wonder if the people working on cracking the iPhone and iPod Touch so that you can put your own software on it, rather than relying purely on software from the Apple Application Store, are in any sort of potential trouble. What they're doing I would argue is fair use, but Apple might not see it that way.)

Very clear and well organized. It was a pleasure to read the slides. Reverse Engineering certainly doesn't get the recognition that it is due which is interesting since it is done every day.

I do think that would be very useful; to see a history of changes and see where those changes were made. Certainly would give you a good sense of the key areas where things matter. The other was the sv3D tool for rendering visual diagrams. Haven't checked on that one but I am going to have a look and see what that looks like.

They did say: \"The outcome was the production of different techniques, i.e., token-based [7, 62], AST-based [10], metrics-based [81], each one ensuring different advantages, such as high precision (AST-based) or high recall (token-based), language independence, or the ability to detect plagiarism (metric-based).\" What might be interesting for future work is to look at using multiple methods in parallel as I would guess you could realize all of the benefits simultaneously.

I've poked around looking to see if I could find a tool to reverse engineer a web 2 application, and couldn't find one. I did find a paper from 2001 (ancient history when it comes to the web) that talked about the capabilities of Frontpage, Dreamweaver, and Smartsite to inspect an existing site and compare reverse engineering tasks such as program analysis, plan recognition, concept assignment, redocumentation, and architecture recovery. None of them were up to the task of doing a good job with the most complex websites, and that was in 2001. I realize those are developer applications. It is possible that there are other tools out there better suited to an actual reverse engineering process on a website. I haven't been able to find it. Part of the reason would be related to the number of languages in use in web applications, such as: Java, Ruby, Perl, C#\/.Net. As far as challenges to, they include: number of languages is use on the web number of languages that could be used in a single application, including both server and client-side code (Javascript) dynamic page creation by the client impact of different browers and how they handle client-side code (this would include things like not supporting standards, bugs specific to specific browers, etc.) no longer reverse engineering a single page; with AJAX you can have multiple requests\/responses to\/from the server on a single page number of servers involved in the backed (code is often distributed on the web server, the data server, and any middle-tier servers, including web-services) That's what comes to mind.

With traditional reverse engineering, well maybe I should say with reengineering, the goal is to reproduce a product not to improve it. Actually this quote from the paper is probably going to be helpful: \"Strictly speaking, reverse engineering does not include restructuring, which is the transformation from one representation form to another (e.g., source-to-source transformations) nor reengineering, which encompasses the alteration of the subject system to reconstitute it in a new form (e.g., migration).\" When it comes to improving design, anything I said should have been in the context of forward engineering (developing entirely new applications). With regards to clone detection, it's helpful to have that in place for a number of reasons: If you're making changes to a piece of code that is cloned somewhere else, it'd be good to know about it so you can make your changes in both places. If possible it'd be good to avoid the clones altogether, so if you were made aware of them, you could refactor your code to not have the clone at all. Thanks for the feedback and the questions.

I actually spent a chunk of time a couple years ago rebuilding a number of statistical reports using C# that were originally generated by COBOL programs. I don't know COBOL but I had to pore of that legacy code to pull out the salient information. I had no problem in doing so as the code was quite readable. Perhaps I would have had more problems if I'd been dealing with more sophisticated programs. Also, it might be a bigger problem with other procedural languages that aren't quite so readable as COBOL. In any case, I don't know that computer science education needs to be about teaching specific languages. I think it's more important that it be about teaching students how to go about learning languages themselves and to see the common elements that exist across all languages. That way they can pick up what they need when they need it. And it's easy enough now to google for an FAQ or a getting started guide to any language. On a somewhat related note the authors did talk about transforming procedural code into object-oriented code: \"While these approaches were very promising and were also complemented by techniques aimed at transforming one language into another [19], doubts have been raised about the comprehensibility and maintainability of the target programs, that often only have the syntax of the target language, without adhering to its philosophy.\" I thought that was quite interesting. After a transformation, you could end up with some functional code in a language that you understand, but it could end up being structured in bizarre way that's hard to understand and maintain. It could be the case that it would be easier to maintain the code in the language it was originally written in, even if you weren't as comfortable using it. Thanks for the feedback.

Although costs can be reduced with shorter times, but there are risks related to project scope creeps. - Your final conclusion was that the final product was with fewer defects, ontime and with higher quality. I take this that there was a comparision in the paper with a similar product that was developed in traditional project management methodologies. Was I right? did the paper include such comparisions? - From your knoweldge working with US government project, can you tell us about which processes in Agile (or in particular eXtreme programing) processes failed to meet CMMI Level 3? Overall the presentation was interesting, and gave some insights on current PM processes used by the US government. However, I have to points to add: - Sometimes the slides were out of synch with your speech. This lead me to slight confusion thinking that the video was lagging behind - The voice was abit low. Otherwise, as I said, the presentation was very interesting.

It was interesting to learn about the government's experiences with XP. I have some questions that involve the fit between Agile methods and the organizations that use them. In your presentation you conclude that XP can be used to quickly deliver quality software in the government. The guide to the SWEBOK, indicates Agile processes are emerging because of demand for fast turnaround of maintenance activities. And in a smaller fast moving company, like a fortune 500 firm, Agile methods seem a natural fit. The values in the methodology line up with the values of the organization. But what about large organizations, like your government example and big private sector monopolies? They are not on the whole apt to value individuals over processes and value collaboration over contract negotiation. In the above post you talk about the resistance to change in the government.

I've been a developer (in a past life), so I have a great deal of interest in concepts like XP. I've also worked for government for the last 10 years, so I'm quite familiar with some of the unfortunate choices that were made here. I have a couple of questions: Given the importance of the pilot project, it may have been better to select developers based in part on their experience with XP, since they were all recently hired contractors anyway. As the paper states, only one of the developers had any XP experience, and the team lead did not enforce many of the XP practices. Granted, it would be useful to determine how an experienced programming team could adapt to this new process, but this adds a new, non-trivial variable, and was probably not the best approach for a project designed to show the proof of the XP concept. How do you think this influenced the results of the case study? At a more detailed level, search capability is a well-known problem and would normally be implemented by reusing components already built, perhaps even using proven commercial components, so this should already be much more efficient than a traditional waterfall development project that would build this capability from scratch. Unfortunately, they appear to have done exactly that. Do you think implementing search heuristics was a good choice for the majority of the XP drops? Should the developers not have also employed other efficient programming techniques such as code reuse? As a future study, I would recommend focusing on Pair Programming as a refinement of the XP concept. As stated, PP was assessed as unimportant, but with both developers sitting in the same cubicle, this would be a natural next step. However, there were other decisions that had more significant negative impact on the pilot - utilizing developers new to XP, redeveloping components that should have been simply sourced and integrated, requiring the developers to cover for other staff on holidays, and so on. Some of these were addressed in the lessons learned, but a second pilot project that corrected these unfortunate choices would be a more fair test of XP.

I would guess that the contractors didn't have anyone on staff with experience in XP to call upon for this pilot because they have to be CMMI compliant which means they would not have had an opportunity to use XP on any previous project. I would also guess that they were only allowed to use XP for this pilot because it was part of a \"study\". Nothing in the paper indicates how the code was developed, either from scratch or by code-reuse, other than to say that there were four code drops. This is significant because in the traditional methodology there would be only a single code delivery and then a user acceptance test.  I agree with you that \"enforcing\" pair programming would have made the results more interesting, but you know, that much change was just too much for the military. I am amazed that a military project would allow any part of XP in their project and so I truly think the entire experiement was successful even if not fully XP. The other thing that amazes me about this pilot is that it took place in 2006. That means that no government project had even tried XP till 2006! Anyway, lots of interesting questions. Thanks.

The title of the paper under review is: \"Classifying Software Changes: Clean or Buggy?\" URL of the Presentation: https:\/\/triton2.athabascau.ca\/vshare\/view\/104\/classifying-software-changes-clean-or-buggy-\/ Abstract: The paper under review suggests a novel technique, Change Classification, for predicting latent software bugs by implementing machine learning algorithms, namely the Support Vector Machine algorithm to classify changes as either clean or buggy immediately after the commit has been made. The classifier is trained using features in the SCM repository of the system under investigation. Results were tested with 12 open source projects with 78% accuracy and a 60% buggy change recall on average.

Improvement of the measures will be achieved with better training samples. Since the training samples depened strongly on how the Software Configuration Management system is used, and what processes are adopted for change management by the interest group regarding those projects or project teams for other projects, I believe a proper framework for change management will definitly improve the results of the debugger. I do hope that the classifier would be tested with non-open source projects, and becomes the norm of use during change management I do realise that some of the slides where with smaller fonts, especially the methodology slide, which was my mistake - since I was considering the full screen size with High Res while I was working on the power point slides.

One of your slides has a graph of Eclipse vs Mozilla. The accuracy of Eclipse is in a tight range (in all cases in the range of high 80% to low 90%) while Mozilla varies significantly and is much lower in accuracy. Did the authors comment on this? Did they give any reason why? Do they plan research into this? Unless I missed something important in your presentation, it seems to me that knowing why Eclipse performed so well would help remove the limitations\/pitfalls of automatically finding bugs in software changes. The graphs in your presentation compared the use of different metrics on accuracy averaged over all the software projects. Did the researchers compare differences between the 12 software projects they tested their technique on? It would be interesting to know if things like the programming language or software complexity affects this technique. Maybe this is a good topic for future research.

I think I should break my answer to bulleted points :-) : It is a very good remark of yours regarding the accuracy. I also considered this as a weakness in the paper. As I mentioned in the presentation, some projects used the bug tracking systems not only for bug reporting, but also for updated features. There fore, some systems would be reporting more bugs then reality (such as Bugzilla). Due to time constraints I couldnt show the table that presents a summary of Corpus information for each project, presenting Eclipse (10.1%) as the project with the least percentage of buggy changes, while that of Mozzila was three times that of Eclipse (29.9%) and that of Bugzilla was (73.7%). Interestingly enough, those values were measured for Revisions 500-750 for Eclipse (250 revisions), 500-1000 for both Mozilla and Bugzilla (500 revisions) respectively. This contradicts with the convential belief that accuracy might improve with the training sample size!!     What I missed presenting - because of time constraints :-) - was that the authors did a correlation study for the 12 projects, using Pearson's correlation. They found out that buggy percentage did indeed affect accuracy with a negative factor of -0.56 and 0.77 and 0.64 for buggy change recall and buggy change precision respectively. The authorels stated there is weak correlation between buggy percentage and accuracy, and weak and insignificant correlation between  buggy percentage and both precision and recall. I would argue that those results are neither weak nor insignificant, and there is a reason to believe that the percentage of bugs reported will definitly effect the accuracy of the training samples. Given the above, many factors could be affecting the results, including how strongly the project teams adhere to chagne management processes, and whather there is a drift in that adherence. Such a drift will also affect negatively on accuracy with time, resulting that any accurate measure will become impossible. I do agree with you on studying the affect of programing langauge and software complexity on accuracy measures. In fact I consider it, as well as the authors did, that the lack of such study is a threat to the validation of the paper, especially, that they did mention that the methodology used is independent of the platform. We are yet to see that in their future work I feel that the tool still predicts the possibility of a bug because of code change and will not give a concrete resjult whether that change will cause a bug. However, this methodology would definitly improve processes in change and configuration management.","courseId":172,"phaseId":3,"postId":49480,"postCreationTime":1243278998,"courseCategoryId":15,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Spring\/09 Archive","postParentId":49423,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d3065b4"},"forumId":1016,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":17387,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 S09","postTitle":"Re: Classifying Software Changes:","courseCategoryName":"Grad Spring\/09 Archives","topicName":"Classifying Software Changes:"},{"postUserId":1329,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Mohammed, It was a very interesting presentation.  Using a classifier right when a change is being made to an application is a good idea. The same issue of false positives that came up in the paper I reviewed comes up here. The only difference here is that I think the F-value needs to be mostly tempered with application complexity. I figure application owners would be more tolerant of false positives if the application was more complex. It would be an interesting project to study that. What do you think? Speaking of complexity it is too bad the authors missed these measures for Mozilla. Mozilla is such a web of code (excuse the pun). The authors say all of the projects are opens source. But Mozilla came from Netscape Inc. It would be interesting to see the research applied to projects that were completely developed by one firm, mixed projects (like Mozilla, Java, ...) and then pure open source software.

In your presentation you mentioned that  other versions of the SVM could be tested but the one used for the paper was optimal.

I was looking forward that they investigate the algorithms used themselves. The algorithm used for the classifier, as well as the one used in identifying bug introducing changes. I found this as one of the discussion weaknesses. I am also not very happy with the choice of the SZZ algorithm since it is known to have many false positives, and many implementations have seen improvement on the performance of the algorithm. A further study on the effect of which implementation of the SZZ algorithm would perform best in this technique is yet to be seen. In an interesting paper, Chadd Williams and Jaime Spacco revisited the algorithm and introduced some changes(Chadd Williams and Jaime Spacco, \"SZZ revisited: verifying when changes induce fixes\", Int'l Symp. Software Testing and Analysis,pp 32-36, 2008). Kim, Pan, White head, and Zimmermann also noted that SZZ has many false positives and negatives (Sunghun Kim, Kai Pan, E. James Whitehead, Jr., and Tom Zimmerman, \"Automatic Identification of Bug-Introducing Changes\",21st IEEE\/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, 2006, 81-90)  . I think testing such implementations will be worth while investigating. The authors didn't suggest any changes in the approach to meet the requirements of environments such as Bugzilla, where change logs are used for bug reporting, as well as new features, more research should be done on whether SZZ is capable enough, or an comparator component to be added, to compare with other such changes if they were truely bugs or merely new features.  ","courseId":172,"phaseId":3,"postId":49678,"postCreationTime":1243592871,"courseCategoryId":15,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Spring\/09 Archive","postParentId":49545,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d302b9b"},"forumId":1016,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":17387,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 S09","postTitle":"Re: Classifying Software Changes:","courseCategoryName":"Grad Spring\/09 Archives","topicName":"Classifying Software Changes:"},{"postUserId":5733,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Mohammed, First a comment :Very interesting and innovative approach for software bugs classification, detection and correction; I think that with the use of modern software development tools the error detection happens sooner at the early stages, especially with features as intellisense and quick testing and debugging already embedded in most of the development platforms, even open source ones such as Eclipse. For this reason I think your presentation is valuable because is addressing the peskiest of the bugs, the latent one; it does not matter how good is the development tool, it can only help to prevent and fix syntactical errors (grammatical, if you wish), but not latent ones that are more related with the logical design of the application and deep coding. So being able to implement a predictive solution is an excellent idea. Question: My question is more related with the tool: It looks to me that you have to define manually the kind of error (family) that you want to focus on, so how does the tool learn?

They use the Support Vector Machine classifier to classfiy bugs as clean or buggy. SVM is considered a powerful set of algorithms to classify mail as Spam or Ham. Orginally it was designed for binary classification. The authors use the same concept. Further reading for the algorithm itself can be found in the following reference if you are interesteed:  T. Joashims, :\"Text Categorization with Support Vector Machines: Leaning with Many Relavant Features\", Proc. of the 10th European Conf. Machine Learning, pp 137-142, 1998 V.N. Vapnik, The Nature of Statiscial Learning Theory, Springer-Verlag, 1995 2. For training, the authors use the SZZ to trace the bugs, and track them down to fixes. SZZ uses a difference tool, which returns a list of regions that are different in the original and revision files, called hunks. It considers each of those hunks in the original file as  bugs. Then, the SZZ uses the built in annotate functionality to tracks down the origins of the deleted or modified source code by computing the most recent revision in which the lines was change and the developer who has made it. This is done for each line of code. Further reading of the SZZ algorithm can be found in: J. Silwerski, T. Zimmermann, and A. Zeller, \"When do changes Induce Fixes\", Proc. Int'l Workshop Mining Software Repositories, pp 24-28, 2005   The problem with this algorithm is that inherently cannot distinguish between changes due to bugs, and changes to add new features! So if a programer is not careful in identifying new features as such, those wil be recorded as bugs in the SZZ algorithm I didnt understand your remarks 1 & 2 3. a) From the change Meta data: author, commit Hour, commit day, cumulative change count, cumulative bug count, length of changed log, changed  LOC noted as Delta including added and deleted, and new revisions source code. b) from the Complexity Metrics, 61 metrics, including LOC, comments, max nesting and cyclometic complexity. c) i- Change Log messages(all words except for special characters)  ii-source code (operators, terms, functions, comments and so on)  iii- and filenames Each file is considered as an instance with a set of features that are grouped together.

Is this the case? I am not sure if I understood you right...The actual algorithms used were basically: A machine learning algorithm to classify new changes whether they are clean or buggy. This was the Support Vector Machine, which views the data fed into the system as two sets of vectors, then tends to maximize the margine between those two sets by drawing a seperating hyperplane between them, reducing generalized errors. In this area, statistics do play a role in this seperation, since machine learning algorithms depend by nature on the trainng samples used. The second set of algorithms used are to create the training samples for the SVM implementation. This is an algorithm that detects whivh chnages in the line of code had introduced a bug. This data, together with other data are used as training meta data for the SVM. I don't believe in this part there is an influence of statistics How does this process work with a new system - perhaps one that was built elsewhere, and is now being taken on for maintenance - when it is not really possible to construct the corpus? Currently, the system has to be trained from historical data extracted from the same project itself. Training is required even further for projects that are under development. The authors haven't investigated accuracy for the example you have mentioned. It could be worth investigating. This would be useful to investigate the accuracy of the classifier when historical versions of the system under development are abscent. Much of the work appears to be based on human review of past changes to create the corpus - if I understand it, they need to first classify changes as bugs or not, and the system can review those classifications and comments in an automated fashion. How effort-intensive is this? Would it be possible to create the corpus from one system, and use it against a different system developed by the same team (or one that has the same change behaviours)? To my understanding, the only part that involves human involvement is the verification part, where someone varifies whether those changes in code were actually bugs, or simply new releases. Again, training data in this paper was extracted from the same project where the classifier was used to detect future bugs. I believe strongly that there would be a better result when both training and implementation system had similar well defined processes for change management, and the developing team used the same annotation while prodcing meta data for both projects then the case you mentioned earlier As for future suggestions, it might be a good idea, but how would you suggest training the Machine learning algorithm??","courseId":172,"phaseId":3,"postId":49905,"postCreationTime":1244312591,"courseCategoryId":15,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Spring\/09 Archive","postParentId":49841,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d30158e"},"forumId":1016,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":17387,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 S09","postTitle":"Re: Classifying Software Changes:","courseCategoryName":"Grad Spring\/09 Archives","topicName":"Classifying Software Changes:"},{"postUserId":1328,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Mohammed, Very interesting presentation thank you.

Software architecture is typically starts off as an idea but is then expressed as a model. In some ways they are similar. However, not every model is a represents software architecture and models are not the only way of expressing software architcture. Software architecture can be expressed using just text but pictures and models seems to get the ideas accross more effectively. Taking that one step further, working models that can be simulated, tested, and subsequently generated (into working executables) makes the system functionally transparent.

Some requirements could be platform dependent. So I assume that those requirements are added on later, in the platform depended model, correct? 3- Is the concept of abstract and concrete syntax in DSM similar to the concept of using interfaces and concrete classes in Object Oriented programing? 4- How did the team of developers work, in the case study referred to by the paper? 5- How was quality ensured, what was used to minimize erosion and drift effects on architecutural design in the case study?

It defines the business domain and should be understood by both the business and technology sides of the team. One of the purposes of the CIM is to identify the system interaction with the environment it is intended to run within. An example might be that customer data and inventory data are used to create a sale. The vocabulary is defined in business terms and sets the precident for the subsequent models. If there are platform specific requirements then yes the platform model should reflect them. Also, the mapping between the PIM and PSM should account for these requirements depending on the nature i.e. compiler specific versus non-functional business requirement. 3- yes and no. Yes because depending on your point of view both are about using abstraction and a decoupled approach. I would say that the DSM is more akin to a specialization of the MDA with the abstract syntax and concrete syntax closer to the PIM and PSM. 4- The paper did not get into the specific of the teams' approach to development. Eventhough one of the target questions in the paper was to identify how software architecture design descision affected the development process. 5- The primary approach was the use of compliance reviews of the detailed design. I think this was one of the key take-aways from this case study. Over time, this does not conclusively stop drift or erosion because the rationale for making design decisions can be interpreted differently as the teams change. Including the rationale explicitly in the model could help this. 6- This is a tough question but I think incorporating another viewpoint into the architecture could help. This viewpoint could focus on decisions and their associated rationale but would have to have tracability to the structural viewpoint in order to provide the intended value. Several questions about the vocabulary to be used would have to be answered and standardized for this to work. Hope this provides some of what you are looking for.

Did author provide any insight on how software architecture drift and erosion were measured? In the paper I presented author measured software erosion based on pattern conformity, modularity and ordering. I believe that Model Driven Development if applied correctly in organization that routinely produces products of roughly same functionality can significantly increase software re-usability costs by significant values.

I too would have had trouble keeping it to 20 minutes. As you point out, the paper is based on a novel case study and is thus difficult to compare to other research. I would go further and question the author's conclusions. The paper concludes that not being able to model architecture design rules leads to problems such as stalled design, premature design, poor communication of architecture, ... . But as implied in a previous post, there were other forces at play. Maybe only having 2 architects on a 24 month, 100 person year, 5 site project made effective communication impossible? The authors seem to make an implicit assumption that enforcing one architectural style is so important. But in the paper reviewed by Yevgeniy a roadmap of more than one architectural style was suggested. A reference architecture then layering was indicated. So I would like to see one or more empirical studies to show the costs and benefits of single versus multiple architectural styles as a function of system type, size, complexity and the like.   Lastly, is an embedded system good for a case study? Typically embedded systems have close ties to hardware and are hence much more constrained. I figure other case studies are needed to see the overall effects of lax architectural design rule enforcement when the system being designed allows for more flexibility.

I think that in today\u2019s software industry, Model Driven Design is a really common and standard practice that speeds the process from design to development and delivery to the final customer. I agree with your comment that most of these Models capture the structure not the intent and when you have to work on the \u201Cintent\u201D (from my point of view the customization part) is when the real problem begins. I believe the authors\u2019 tried to close this gap. Another comment is related with communication; we have fancier and better tools that in theory could facilitate the communication part, but, then we depend too much on them leading to: lack of communication (the assumption is that everything is in the model so don\u2019t ask and look there for information), flood of communication because the tools produces a considerable amount of information the reviewing process becomes more and more cumbersome (you mentioned the two designers reviewed close to 166 objects) . My question here is how do you see the communication being improved with the usage of this model or how it can be improved?

I think that delegation as pointed out in the previous posts might be a way to address this problem. Not purely to remove the bottleneck but also to more evenly distribute the ideas and rationale for the decisions made. If early in the project each individual project team has an expert who understands the intent of the design and can evangelize it to the team, this can make better use of the communication provided by toolsets. This is because there can be several explanations of the architectural design decisions, and assuming they are all accurately describing the same rules but using different styles to do so, team members from any location have more direct access to the information. However, this doesn't address the long-term capture of these decisions very well. Once the project is complete teams typically disband and move  on to other endeavours with a small subset remaining. Not sure if this answers your question.

I think my first run through was 32 minutes. I enjoyed the presentation, though, particularly the way that it touches on elements from some of the other presentations. It really illustrates some of these common modeling issues. On the Software Architecture slide, there's a discussion about software architecture drift and erosion, which was also discussed in one of the other papers. Did the authors discuss the differences between drift and erosion, and the circumstances under which each can occur? The Combitech case study seems to have been impacted by that short time-to-market constraint, which required simultaneous hardware and software development. Did it seem that this was a good driver for a case study, or might it have been more appropriate to select something with fewer variables to show a better test of the MDD principles? Did the authors assess these issues? As a future research topic, I would suggest more investigation of the formal modeling concepts - I believe the authors were interested in seeking out tools that can enforce compliance to modeling rules, but there may be value in further attention to the modeling rules themselves, through adjustment of the models or simply providing additional training. This might allow them to adjust the compliance approach (i.e. better compliance = less compliance activity, shifting from \"check everything\" to \"selective audits\").

Actually the paper I reviewed did not specifically discuss drift or erosion, based on my research of software architecture it was inferred. The authors did assess the challenge of developing hardware and software concurrently and decided that it was a driver for using MDD. The level of abstraction provided allowed for a design targeted at an execution framework instead of the underlying hardware. As for the choice of a heavily time constrained project, the authors did not comment. I would assume that the authors were willing to take what they could get. This was a relatively large project that was able to provide intimate details due to the relationship of the primary author. I'm not sure I totally agree, in this case the level of review seems to have suffered anyways so a more selective approach may have worked. But, if the project was focused on a steering control system (for SAAB) I would feel better if all designs were reviewed for compliance.

Although the authors did not provide us a solution for automating the testing of interfaces, they did point out that with various modeling and constrain languages gaining mainstream acceptance, there are opportunities for formal methods research to address this issue in distributed development. The authors also speculated the possibility of generating \"smart simulator\" of remote modules based on the formal interface description. Such simulators can be used for conducting \"pre-integration\" checks on each remote site. I think if model driven approach is used in the distributed environment, such automatically generated simulators would greatly help in eliminating the ambiguity of interface descriptions. Regarding de-sensitizing production data, the authors did not theorize an solution. Here is an interesting research paper that was mentioned which might help you: \"Privacy Preserving Database Application Testing\" http:\/\/doi.acm.org\/10.1145\/1005140.1005159 The above paper proposed a technique for generating intelligent test database by first extracting rules and statistical data from the production database and then synthesizing random data into test database according to the extracted rules.

I found the volume to be a little too low on the last few slides, but other than that it was excellent! The authors list one of the perceived benefits of distributed design to be lower development cost. I wonder if this refers to the salary of programmers only or are there studies that looked at the total system cost? The non-technical issues (language, culture, different laws, etc) could lead to lower quality in requirements engineering. This could lead to failed projects, more rework and maintenance. The paper from our unit 2 readings, \u201CQuality Assurance in Requirements Engineering\u201D (Denger, C. and T. Olsson (2005), \"Quality Assurance in Requirements Engineering,\" In Engineering and Managing Software Requirements, A. Aurum and C. Wohlin, Eds., Springer, Berlin, Germany, pp. 163-185. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/3-540-28244-0_8) states that 40% of problems during design result from low quality requirements. They found that testing and rework accounts for 40 to 50% of development cost. This could lead to more problems after the design is completed. As I learned from research for my presentation, up to 90% of total system costs is software maintenance (Erlikh L. Leveraging legacy system dollars for E-business. IEEE IT Pro 2000; 2(3):17\u201323).

I really enjoy it, especially about the proposed practices of identified challenges. In my real work, I do experience these two main challenges that have been mentioned in the article: requirement evolving and people vs process oriented control. Currently, I am working on a project converting existing architecture into a SOA architecture. The target architecture is highly distributed, which means more than one team, one site, one vendor, have been involved with the whole process. I find those practices can be really helpful. We decided not to use Agile methodology with our SOA approach because of the requirement from government.

It would be interesting to see the result if the interview was done on a larger international remote team base.

The topic is interesting, and I appreciated the fact that the authors did not simply identify the problems with Distributed Software Development, but also proposed solutions. With respect to the background information, did the authors investigate to what extent companies were outsourced? For example, the point about the cost savings associated to DSD and outsourcing to India - was there any review of whether support and maintenance was also outsourced, perhaps even co-located with the developers, and whether this impacted the effectiveness of the developer teams? With respect to the issues of data privacy, was there any assessment of how much, or how often, this problem occurs? It's a question I find very interesting because I work in government, and we do encounter this issue quite frequently.

It was hard to make it shorter without losing some context. To answer your question I am going to include the full findings from the authors' regarding CSV: \"Using the taxonomy, the CVS system can be positioned as a compile-time, manual-change mechanism that supports semantics-preserving and semantics-changing evolutions. The file-based approach is one of the main strengths of CVS, but at the same time it is also the most important weakness. From the positive side, the file-based approach makes CVS general purpose, since it can be used in a platform independent way and any kind of software artifact can be versioned as long as it is stored in file format. From the negative side, the granularity of changes is always restricted to files, which makes it very difficult to deal with relationships at a higher or lower level of granularity. As a result, CVS has poor support for change propagation or behavioural safety, because this requires information about the software that is not directly accessible in the CVS file format.\" So in conclusion I will say that CSV supports change but it is not optimal, according to proposed model. As per the presentation, my apologies, I tried three different tools and I did not get the expected results, but I found that if you increase the screen size then it looks better and you should be able to see the details that are hard to see on the regular size.

I agree with you that most of these classifications (taxonomies) do not consider the cost as one of the dimensions but then, if you look for a moment, one can argue that the WHY somehow is considering this aspect, but it is not directly shown on the proposed models. What I know is that some organizations have some sort of point system that assess cost as part of the main reasons to replace or update an application but then again we are talking about the WHY not the HOW. Other organizations use a Complexity Matrix that includes cost and technical reasons to replace an application. The purpose of this paper it was to show some additional dimensions that, in my personal opinion, should be considered at design time to facilitate the change (maintenance) process of an application looking at the future and, unfortunately, cost is not one of them but in all fairness if you apply the framework (based on this topology) your maintenance cost could be reduced.

I'll try to answer your questions: 1. It has been augued that all Agile methods, XP included, are extentions of previously defined incremental and iterative approaches to software development. Prototyping was used in incremental and iterative development methods of the past, such as RAD. But I think there is a significant difference betwee prototyping and XP in that XP focusses on \"working software\" that cold be delivered to the customer. Prototyping was more intended to develop a model of the software and not working software, although in some cases the prototype may have become the defacto product.  2. The research paper did not explicity mention the budget or schedule other than to generalize that this project seemed to be \"faster\" than other projects. The research paper actually mentioned scope creep to highlight the difference between XP methods and waterfall methods because XP welcomes when handling changing requirements. Agile methodologies stress responding to changng requirements even though they will affect the project plan, where-as plan-driven methods would have tried to stop changing requirements from being addressed because they change the project plan. I agree that one case study cannot be used to generalize, but in this case the lesson is that even the US military, which is bound by CMMI, can have success using agile methods.

And you are correct, it is hard to gleam the purpose of XP from the research paper as the paper is really about the results of introducing XP to an organization that is bound by CMMI and therefore would not normally use XP as a methodology. I think XP's purpose is to provide a software development methodology that is more focussed on the \"human\" aspects of software development. Afterall, software development is still about smart people using their knowledge to craft something that is \"recognizable\" to both other humans and to computer systems. XP provides a framework to work in that allows the developers to work on what they like to work on - developing software.   Collective ownership in the context of XP means that everyone on the team is responsible for working on the code, including refactoring it when needed. I believe this is also the normal mode in OpenSource development but I don't have any direct experience in OpenSource, so I am not certain.

You do tend to speak about the content not read the slides so much which I think helps to hold the attention of the listener. My question revolves around the scope of this research. Although I certainly understand the premise for this study I am not sure how conclusive their results are when the scale is so small in relation to the very large projects that governments usually work on. As you indicate in your conclusions the authors recognise the need to expand the research. With your personal knowledge of development on a larger scale do you think this methodology would scale to the highly controlled environment of government and specifically the US military, particularly as they require such control over processes? It also didn't appear that the researchers had as much influence over the actual process when 7 out of 8 of the surveys were returned and 3 were eliminated because they did not answer all the questions. Were the researchers involved in the project from start to finish or just attempting to quantify the results for case study analysis?

The main reason for the US Military to take so long in adopting Agile methods is because of the mandate for all software development organizations to be CMMI certified. Becoming CMMI certified is very demanding and after exerting that much effort it is difficult to change. So, the study is really about opening up the possibility for Agile methods to be used in this context - organizations mandated to be CMMI certified. If the US Military is willing to use XP, then its contractors might take a look at it. Scaling up Agile methodologies has been a popular research topic in recent years.

To your points: 1. The paper does present a single case study, and recognizes the limitations of such. But there were just no other case studies like it to compare it to. This may have been the first of its kind. In the world of CMMI compliance and US Government projects, it isn't easy to be a trail-blazer.  2.  I agree. Being dedicated to a project allows one the luxury of not multi-tasking. 3. I have no experience with SCRUM, but the papers I've read which discuss SCRUM and XP usually link them like this: SCRUM is more about project management and XP has more of a \"code-related\" flavor to it. SCRUM is the project managers methodology whereas XP is the software developers methodology and very often they are used together - as in \"the project is a SCRUM\/XP project.\" 4. The paper you've pointed out is presenting XP as a \"collaboration-related\" tool. I like this idea, that XP is a set of methods that fosters collaboration between different interests in a software project. In this case the project was to reverse engineer a legacy application and then re-develop it and the customer outsourced both the reverse engineering and re-development to a firm located in China. The paper points out that collaboration is both necessary for success and is provided by XP methods and therefore appropriate for an off-shore project. This contrasts with my paper in many ways ( ie, in my paper the project did not need reverse engineering and was not off-shore) but the fact that using XP methods facilitated improved communication is shown to be true in both papers.     Thanks, Jeanne","courseId":196,"phaseId":3,"postId":57395,"postCreationTime":1263955231,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57345,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306cac"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19714,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: A Case Study: Introducing eXtreme Programming in a US Government System Development Project","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"A Case Study: Introducing eXtreme Programming in a US Government System Development Project"},{"postUserId":3913,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Jeanne, Nice Presentation. That's a first for me! I was always under the impression that a government organization would have preference to waterfall, because the document intensiveness provided some sort of project security... I have a bone of contention with one of the points: Collective ownership - it will be interesting to see how a government organization will enforce developers to take accountability for the code, and be able to make changes to the system in question, in a so-called agile framework at any time, especially if the system is huge and mission critical. The reason being that most government organizations have huge bureaucracies, and have a history for not making timeous decisions. And, like organizations in the private sector, government organizations have staff turnovers. Thus, if no documentation was produced for the latest firmware that interfaced with a new scud missile launcher, because all the developers were focused on being agile, what does the government organization do??

Good questions! I'll try to answer: 1. This paper did not go into details about refactoring and it is not clear if the code was, in fact, refactored. From other research, I think not, since this was a single \"enhancement\" request. Usually, refactoring is used when a software is being extensively worked on, with many enhancement requests, such as would be the case in a software product being re-built to accomodate really different types of enhancements. Refactoring is the process to changing the \"architecture\" of the software to make it easier to add new functionality. 2. I don't have any direct experience with this, but I would guess that the functional manager would have to be self-motivated to becoming a usefull participant in the agile project. If they don't have that level of self-motivation then why is the software being developed for them in the first place?

The data used in the study that was collected - I'm not sure how it was used in the research.

For all the projects being studied the following data was collected: Process maturity measurements (An indication of how close a process is to being developed and complete) was accomplished by government auditors and company personnel. Other data? was collected by the technology firm and audited by the clients Cycle time was retrieved from the corporate project management scheduling system. Effort data was tracked by the corporate time reporting system. Software defect data was extracted from the Configuration Management database Estimated budget, Actual duration, Software development cost - were all manually coded from electronic and paper files The SPQR20 tool aggregated and normalized some of this data and provided a consistent methodology for estimation of budget and schedule. All of this data was then analyzed by both the technology firm and the researchers. We are not given detailed specifics of exactly what was done to the data only the outcomes of the regression models and descriptive statistics. I imagine they did not feel it was relevant to provide that much granularity in their paper but might produce it upon request. We are given enough information however to appreciate there was a lot of rigour in getting reliable, consistent and valid data for their research. I was actually pretty impressed by the sheer amount of work this would have taken to not only determine what data was needed, but mobilize this company to gather it and then process it. As to the second question I think they did realize that data collected from only one company was not totally conclusive and that the data set needed to be expanded to multiple companies and more projects - which I think is their intent.

To answer your questions: 1. Their original hypothesis surrounded how they thought it should operate which would then be born out by empirical data. That too \"loose\" a schedule would cause developers to \"overworry\" a project paying too much attention to detail and lengthening the development time. Conversely too much compression of the schedule results in developers not being able to meet deadlines, shortcuts are taken and the defect rate goes way up resulting in even longer delays. So they hoped that the data would show this relationship. In fact it didn't and resulted in a linear relationship. Subsequent analysis of the data showed that when clients were involved in providing data input for the software development process (specifically scheduling, code development and test with audits) through the assessment tool - they never shortened their review time even when the time was under original schedule pressure estimates. So the researchers felt this skewed the data resulting in erroneous results. On subsequent research they felt this could be mitigated with more rigorous education regarding giving accurate analysis by the customers. 2. It said it was basically a linear relationship. Unfortunately we don't get to see this. I would have liked to have seen the actual graphs. 3. The negative impact resulting from client involvement was the fact that data gathered by the client was not totally accurate and skewed the results for schedule pressure. Otherwise it seems like the clients were very cooperative with the process as outlined.

To answer your questions: 1. In Unit 1 there was a very strong case made for software engineering being incorporated within the sphere of engineering rather than computer science - which definitely seems to have its merits. In this particular paper the premise for too little pressure or too much pressure is based on Brook's Law \"where adding manpower to a late software project only makes it later\". They infer that this is where traditional engineering (say structural engineering) may differ. As an example, when a bridge is being built adding manpower may in fact accelerate the build and result in a shorter cycle time. With software development the difference in communication, programming dynamics and the lead time for people to become familiar with the project, then understand the code and so forth makes adding manpower much more complex and in fact extends the time. The researchers hypotheses is \"some pressure\", say 0-10% would result in shorter development time and effort whereas too much pressure would only extend the time and effort. 2. Finding the \"sweet spot\" (my words) can be achieved by analyzing the initial estimates of schedule time and effort and budget time and effort by the developers and comparing this to that of the customers. Their thinking is that the developers time frame will be very realistic for \"optimum\" pressure however in actual fact increasing the pressure by no more than 10% will result in better cycle time and effort. This seems to have been born out regarding budget pressure but was not for schedule pressure for which they have an explanation. Hope that explains it!

Not specifically fast-tracking but more how does pressure (from budget and schedule) affect cycle time and effort. So with budget pressure the example would be if the developer estimated the budget to be $100,000 and the client disagreed and said $94,000 would be a more accurate estimate then the result would be a discrepancy of .06 or 6%. Their research showed that when the development team were faced with a budget pressure less than 10% (as in this case) they were able to come in under budget with both cycle time and effort reduced. This only relates to budget pressure as their original hypotheses for scheduling pressure was not substantiated. 2.

In as much as I fully agree with what the authors pointed out with regards to 'too much or too little pressure' affects the software development lifecycle, I would like to also point out a couple of things: 1. In the workplaces that I have been at, the 'pressure' tool has been abused to benefit a minority of individuals within an organization. Thus in reality, it is not always a win-win situation. 2. It is also important to bear in mind that in order for budgets to be effective in a project, communication amongst members of the project, and within the organization, is key. It is pointless for a minority group in an organzation to be aware that a certain project has been tagged at a certain amount, and leave another group completely in the dark, especially a development team that will implement the project. I know, you're probably wondering, why must the developers know how much the project that they are currently working on is costing the organization. Well, that was one of the many burning questions that was doing its rounds at the last company that I worked at, before I was given the chop, along with other people in the organization. 3. To be transparent about a project in all aspects is a holy grail, and unfortunately, the project budget transparency is just one of the many things that is not including in good corporate governance, especially when a project overruns, and the organization is forced to cut jobs in order to stay afloat... 4. The authors should have placed more emphasis as to the types of pressure imposed on project teams, that way one can establish not only how much pressure to exert, but also what type of pressure to exert, in order to get th desired result.

The researchers actually confirmed this by saying that \"some\" budget pressure can be positive - 0-10% however more tends to have not appreciable gain or can have a negative effect. As for schedule pressure their original hypothesis about some pressure was not confirmed and Brooks Law seems to take precidence \"adding manpower to a late software project makes it later\" and in fact only makes it worse. They did indicate that they felt there were mitigating factors which needed to be explored however. In regards to your second comment, I would agree again - why not be open with the process? It would appear in this particular case however, that everyone from the researchers to the managers, customers and programmers (developers) were involved in the discussion and there was a great deal of communication. They knew about the budget and schedule and were involved in estimating and post-project analysis. Having this level of communication helped to ensure that transparency I think, although this is not expressly stated. I am not sure how \"pressure\" was communicated to the programmers doing the work as we don't get that kind of minutia in the paper. It \"appears\" to have been communicated to all parties but this is an assumption on my part.

As well there is an estimate or budget of projected total costs as established by the customer. This occurs when the original development project is negotiated. The authors established from previous studies that in all cases analyzed the projected costs of the client is always less than that of the developer - on average around 9.5%. When these two numbers are compared, the relationship between them is the \"pressure\" that is put upon the developer by the customer to bring the cost down. The authors premise was, that if there is \"some\" pressure (the unknown quantity) to reduce the estimate originally developed by the developer it actually turns out to be beneficial. They wanted to empirically establish what percentage of \"pressure\" would prove beneficial until it starts to become a detriment. There is a similar pressure for schedule as well. The result of their study was some budget pressure, or reduction from the developer budget, was beneficial (up to 10%) whereas the hypothesis about schedule pressure did not prove to be substantiated. However they did feel they understood what factors were influencing this outcome. This was a very good question and I hope that answers it adequately.

One point though, I think you could have stressed the researchers findings a bit more, that Distributed SCRUM achieved development performances that are much higher than any waterfall methodology could. I would direct you to a follow on paper which verifies these findings, that Distributed Scrum is 5-10 times more productive than waterfall methodologies. This paper goes on to show that this productivity is achievable even when the distributed teams do not have overlapping time zones - such as was the case in your presentation paper. With these reseach papers (and others) showing the viability of Distributed SCRUM I believe that Distributed SCRUM will be become the model of choice for software development organizations seeking to leverage developer talent worldwide.

Your voice was clear and I was able to hear you clearly. One obervation from the project is that Scrum projects consist of a whole lot of meetings, I was tempted to ask the question where is the time to do the project when you are always in meetings? But you answered that question when you mention the number of lines of code done by the programmers. The questions I have are the following: 1. You mention that Scrum is similar to XP, in that case what is the difference between Scrum and prototyping if any? 2. The presentation identified a large number of problems with software development, did the paper offer solutions to these problems? I believe these are the same problems that are identified in traditional programming for which solutions are still very difficult to find. 3.

Scrum sprints can be used to prototype. However, this is not common practice. Sprints are typically used to develop 'real' parts of the system so that they can be demonstrated to the stakeholders at the sprint review meeting. 2. The paper did not offer solutions to problems with software development. It was more concerned with the implementation of the Integrated Scrums model. 3. Unfortunately the paper did not state whether the project was fixed bid or not. If I had to guess I would probably say that it was not fixed bid. However, having worked on a project that was fixed bid and using Scrum, I can say that it did not work. That is not to say that it can't work. As far as the project budget is concerned, the sponsor tends to get upset when change requests are brought to them on a daily basis and they're forced to obtain more funding. This has a side effect on the completion date because if changes are accepted, then the delivery date has to be pushed out. Hope this answers your questions.

My only criticism regarding the presentation was reading the slides rather than speaking to them. My attention is always grabbed a bit more when a speaker talks about the information rather than reads it. I have always felt that the slides were more of a reference for notes. Saying that I know from experience that speaking this way is a very difficult task. My first question revolves around the results of the study which appears quite amazing. I would like to know if the researchers found additional rationale for the 10:1 increase in the production of the code? I am thinking about human dynamics. Was this remarkable productivity attributed to just the use of SCRUM or were there additional human dynamics at work here? Were they more motivated, more focused, more proficient, or qualified or experienced? Did they comment on this in any way? The second follows along this thought. If the amazing success was not attributed to any particular human dynamic are the researchers planning on expanding the research to other companies and software development projects? If so what are their plans for future research? This would seem to be a significant development process if it achieved this kind of success. Thanks again for this.

In response to your first question, the paper did not address the increase in code output specifically. However, it claims that success stems from the way the following are handled, Team Formation, Scrum Meetings, Sprints, Product Specifications, Testing, Configuration Management, XP Practices, and Measuring Progress. Furthermore, the paper mentions that all team members should be proficient with Agile practices and all teams must function as one team. In regards to your second question, the paper does not refer to any future work. However, I think it's fair to assume that we will see more on this research for a number of reasons. First of all, there are quite a few papers on Distributed Agile Development. Secondly, with the impact of the current economy, more and more companies are looking to outsource. Thirdly, the first author listed in this article (Jeff Sutherland) is a co-founder of Scrum, and I'm sure he's already trying to promote this methodology to various companies.

Just a couple of points: 1. From personal experience, a pure scrum development framework is dependent on the business model of a company, and is likely to be modified in order to meet the needs and business model of an organization. That said, some of the points that you mentioned could be left out or be modified. 2. I fully agree with the authors' emphasis on communication, in order for distributed scrum to work. From personal experience, I have seen what happens when an organization deviates from this... 3. An organization that does not understand the basic concepts of SCRUM has a tendency to create a mish-mash of principles and process, in order to compensate for things that they missed, or did not understand. Just one question: Do you think that before an organization considers doing projects in a distributed scrum framework, they must first understand the rudiments of an agile development framework, and get it working within their own organization, before taking on work that involves interaction between organizations? I.e. getting their own house in order, before telling the other neighbors how to sweep their floor... What do you think? Once again, nice presentation!

Some people feel that agile methodologies must be followed by the book. However, I feel that they should be followed by the book for the first (and many even the second) sprint. After that, the team should decide how to modify the methodology to fit the project. So getting it working within their own organization would help for real outsourced projects, but I do not feel that it is necessary because the methodology will be tweaked anyways.

To answer your question, yes, reverse engineering was and still is used for procedural languages and a procedural code base. Many parsers were created earlier in the 90's for this purpose, which is just one phase of the overall approach to the reverse engineering process. From my research, reverse engineering works just as well on procedural as it does on object oriented code. If there is any advantage it would be for procedural because of the dynamic JIT class loading and reflection type constructs found in Java and .Net, which makes it more difficult. As far as converting from one language to the next...this can be better summarized by explaining the approaches taken to solve this issue. 1. manually rewrite the existing system 2. use an automatic language translator. This could be using a toolkit involving parsers. 3. Redesign and re-implement the system. Reverse engineering is more often concerned with using an approach to capture the design and functionality of a system. Often the term re-engineering is used to refer to the practice of recreating an implementation, redesigning or enhancing software based on this discovered information. Hopefully, this answers your questions properly.","courseId":196,"phaseId":3,"postId":57790,"postCreationTime":1264628168,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57541,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306d26"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19897,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Understanding Web Applications through Dynamic Analysis","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Understanding Web Applications through Dynamic Analysis"},{"postUserId":5739,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Darrell,          Very interesting presentation.

The authors reiterated the framework performed as detailed in the paper, providing the UML diagrams with extra annotations adding more information to benefit the developer such as indicating frequency of calls to reveal stronger class associations. Also, they measured the overhead of the dynamic analysis infrastructure. However, as explained, they lack any real quantifiable results, and only indicated that the performance degradation was negligible. Yes, the authors did believe that the results could be obtained on larger commercial applications, mainly because the performance measurements as to their analysis proved negligible. In my opinion, this paper appeared as more of an introduction to their approach to reverse engineer the dynamic nature of software, with the introduction of a tool to prove their hypothesis. I have been searching for further information on the tool, to see if it has evolved and what type of commercial applications might exist in this arena.

I looked for research regarding those areas prior to the topic selection. I didn't find much of anything in the areas of RIA reverse engineering, however, there are some publications on reverse engineering SOA architectures and technologies. I was encouraged to keep that area under wrap, as other courses cover that topic in more depth You touch on an important theme in this research area. There are so many technologies and they can be mixed extensively in a single project, which makes a diverse reverse engineering tool extremely difficult to create. Also, when creating such a tool, you have to assume the development team acutally uses some concrete patterns, and doesn't leave a pile of spaghetti code. In my opinion, that's probably the exact reason there isn't an extensive list of commercial tools on the market. I would not be surprised to see this area of research remain in the academic arena for quite some time.

I believe, this is the main area of its use because of the intervention that is required by the developers to interpret and analyse the results. This could probably be attributed to the fact that large applications developed at companies are rarely designed and orchestrated by the same team throughout its lifecylce. The design, may become hacked over time, which would make it more difficult to create out of the box uses in the other areas mentioned. To answer your second question: The dynamic analysis WANDA offers is due to program parameters, database queries, and the composition of distributed components often in the form of services(web services). The program parameters may not be determined until runtime, and the database queries are often wrapped by other code fragments. This invocation of these services is from the client which is an operation of late binding. Also, the operations carried out by use of client side scripts is unknown at compile time, making it dynamic. These areas are analyzed at runtime, which the authors refer to as instrumenting the web application, in an attempt to uncover the features of the WA and allow WANDA to collect information of its operations. WANDA's modular approach is composed of subsystems to account for these scenarios and introspect their behaviour at different points of operation. This is different than static analysis that can simply reverse engineer a monolithic type desktop application that may not have client side script or be composed of multiple web service calls. I hope, I have answered your questions thoroughly.","courseId":196,"phaseId":3,"postId":57819,"postCreationTime":1264691523,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57744,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306d1b"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19897,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Understanding Web Applications through Dynamic Analysis","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Understanding Web Applications through Dynamic Analysis"},{"postUserId":1918,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Darrell, Good presentation!

With regards to the diagrams in the paper, due to limitations in time, both in preparing the presentation and the length of the presentation, I did not feel that the diagrams added enough to the presentation to include them.

However, I'm glad that you were interested enough in the topic to look deeper into it. I do not feel that their results as described in the paper are statistically significant. They are generalizing from one, albeit complicate model which uses many of the features of the LQN model, to imply that every model will have if not similar, acceptable error rates.

Often such services were not planned to be under SOA. Not applicable for LQN Service loose coupling \u2013 Services maintain a relationship that minimizes dependencies and only requires that they maintain an awareness of each other. No. Services are allowed to call other services, and may be tightly coupled with them. Service contract \u2013 Services adhere to a communications agreement, as defined collectively by one or more service-description documents. Not applicable. In the LQN, we are merely showing information flow, not communications protocols. Service abstraction \u2013 Beyond descriptions in the service contract, services hide logic from the outside world. Maybe. Depending on the level that the IS was modeled to, the logic may or may not be abstracted. Service reusability \u2013 Logic is divided into services with the intention of promoting reuse. No. You are modeling a specific IS. The LQN can not be reused unless the IS implements the function in the same way (just because there is a web server being modeled in two different LQNs does not mean that their LQN will be similar) Service composability \u2013 Collections of services can be coordinated and assembled to form composite services. Maybe. Service autonomy \u2013 Services have control over the logic they encapsulate. Yes Service optimization \u2013 All else equal, high-quality services are generally preferable to low-quality ones. Yes Service discoverability \u2013 Services are designed to be outwardly descriptive so that they can be found and assessed via available discovery mechanisms[7].

I was looking forward to viewing your presentation when I read the title, but I would have to agree with a few others that I was waiting for more of an explanation of what an LQN is. I am familiar with queuing technologies offered in java and .net and their implications in a distributed environment, but I felt I was missing something at the beginning of the presentation. Maybe, that was just me. I was waiting for a quick slide to present how LQN were different than regular queuing services that may be offered by JMS or IBM's MQSeries. Although, I do understand your points, that you didn't want to make the presentation about the architecture and 20 minutes isn't much time to sum up a broad topic such as this. On the positive side, it left me interested in further searching out material on LQN's at Carleton. This is exactly the idea I have been visioning for our coordinator service at work. I will be looking into carleton's work much more. I do have a couple questions that I am still unsure of. Would you say that using acyclic graphs with LQNs is a main feature to this idea as mentioned in Carleton's research? Also, do these queues offer mechanisms to provide some type of fault tolerance to replay a request if a deadlock occurs at some point in the path? Along the same path, could LQNs be extended as more of a work flow concept which could start, stop and replay messages?","courseId":196,"phaseId":2,"postId":57889,"postCreationTime":1264813119,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57519,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306d3e"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19898,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Enhanced Modeling and Solution of Layered Queueing Networks","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Enhanced Modeling and Solution of Layered Queueing Networks"},{"postUserId":4275,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Darell, I would certainly agree that acyclic graphs are a key feature to this idea. That feature guarantees that there is an end to any chain that is being followed, which allows the chain to be solved analytically. With regards to your second question, if I understand you correctly, the answer would be no. What I understand from my research is that the LQN model does not pass the actual messages throughout the model, but rather is modeling the time and resources consumed by each step in the model. This means that while you can design your model to be fault tolerant to a deadlock, for instance by using the quorum feature with parallelism, if the model deadlocks, the outcome is that the model will not solve. As you probably know, whenever the question is asked 'is something possible' in an IT related field, the answer is normally something on the line of 'How much are you willing to pay'. Yes, the system could probably be modified to stop, start and record messages. But it would not be a trivial task, and the resultant application would likely look nothing like what we started with.

Did the researchers indicate that they planned to continue the research beyond one case study to verify their data? As well did they actually extend the UML model or use existing annotations to diagram and explain LQN?

The author concedes that the analytic solution is not always as accurate as a simulated solution, with the main advantage being speed of solution, and in my opinion, the main disadvantage being the lack of a confidence interval being given around the solution. The authors did not compare the accuracy of the different analytic solvers, only their feature sets. What I believe that the authors meant with their statement \"A subtle advantage of the present approach is, that it makes replication a parameter of the model, so it can be rapidly studied as a parameter change, rather than requiring re-structuring for each level of replication\" is that in the LQN Solver, replication does not require a modification to the base equation for the network (or the solution time for the equation). In a simulator, if replication is modified, it tends to be a much more intensive recalculation before the simulation can proceed. I hope this answers your questions. -rob","courseId":196,"phaseId":2,"postId":58198,"postCreationTime":1265304277,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":58180,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d3022b3"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19898,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Enhanced Modeling and Solution of Layered Queueing Networks","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Enhanced Modeling and Solution of Layered Queueing Networks"},{"postUserId":5739,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Reference to the Article: Cheng, B.H.C. and J.M.

With regards to your critism my idea was to present some text to add more content to the presentation since you can pause the presentation and read. To answer your question, getting the researchers and practioners to improve the process is a challenge since most empirical Rquirements Engineering research takes the form of proofs-of-concept or pilot studies, both of which qualitatively evaluate how well a proposed solution or technique applies to a single concrete problem. Such studies tend to be aimed at research audiences, and are intended to convince readers that the Requirements Engineering technologies under evaluation advance the state of the art. One of the authors recommendation of which I strongly agree is for Industrial organizations to provide (sanitized) industrial-strength project data to researchers. It is especially critical that industry provide realistic data for ultra-large scale or cyber-physical systems to ensure that researchers tackle problems that are representative of those faced by practitioners. Researchers can use this data to guide the development and validation of their new techniques, thereby yielding more relevant and useful research results that explicitly address industrial needs. I believe that  practitioners would benefit greatly from empirical studies that assess the costs and benefits of using proposed technologies, assess the scope of problems to which research results can feasibly be applied, and compare the effectiveness of competing technologies.

With regards to your observation and question, the paper went heavy on Solution base approach and lighter on evaluation base research. The following is some further details on evaluation base research: Current technologies can be supported by new methodologies, patterns, strategies, and tools that ease their use and help to promote their adoption by practitioners. Empirical research can determine the problems and contexts for which a technology is most effective, and can identify aspects that could be further improved. Proposed Requirements Engineering technologies become theories, solutions, or practices through evaluation-based research that demonstrate effectiveness. Evaluation techniques include experience, collection and analysis of data, field studies, case studies, controlled experiments, and analytical reasoning. Evaluation criteria range from qualitative or statistical metrics, to effectiveness in solving real or realistic problems, to comparisons with competing technologies. A mature Requirements Engineering technology should be evaluated on real-world applications or in an industrial setting, to assess its scalability, practicality, and ease of use. Evaluation-based research need not be a massive undertaking. A case-study may be based on a single study involving an industrial-strength project, on replicated studies of the same project, on studies of multiple projects, or on a longitudinal study that spans several phases of a project. Even the development of new assessment criteria, such as appropriate benchmarks, are valuable research contributions.    Again Thanks for your kind assessment","courseId":196,"phaseId":2,"postId":57715,"postCreationTime":1264471141,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57707,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306d13"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19930,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Research Directions in Requirements Engineering","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Research Directions in Requirements Engineering"},{"postUserId":5098,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Donovan, I just finished listening to your paper.

To answer your question What I think the future holds for this type of research? and which direction I think it will move towards?  My answer is as follows: I think the future for this type of reserch is very bright, since the success of a software system depends on how well it fits its users. Since software requirements comprise these needs, and Requirements Engineering is the process by which the requirements are determined. Requirements Engineering can only be improved to successfully understand the needs of users, customers and all stakeholders. Answering the second question, I believe the research is leaning heavily towards solution-base research and to a lesser extent on evaluation-based research. The trend is moving more towards Elicitation, Modeling, Requirements Analysis, Verification & Validation and Requirements Management. However, evaluation-based research has it part to play in the improvement of Requirements Engineering. Again thanks for your assessment, the points are well noted.","courseId":196,"phaseId":3,"postId":57718,"postCreationTime":1264472777,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57711,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d3019c9"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19930,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Research Directions in Requirements Engineering","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Research Directions in Requirements Engineering"},{"postUserId":1394,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Donovan, Interesting topic, you covered the material well and I really enjoyed the high energy you put into this presentation! Quite a few questions came to my mind as I listened. 1. How did the authors determine the nine hotspots? Why these nine and not some others? 2. Are these new hotspots? Other than globalization, the other eight would seem to have been relevant 10 years ago, even 20 years ago. What has changed to make these issues \"hot\".  3. I think it might be a bit naive to assume that \"industry\" has the information that the researchers need\/want and that the challenge is simply to get access to that information. More likely industry simply does not have any information, particularly qualitative information. Why do the researchers think that industry is hoarding valuable information? 4. The researchers seem to be implying that RE researchers are not doing their job \"properly\". But the authors are RE researchers? Are they berating their own work?  Cheers, Jeanne","courseId":196,"phaseId":2,"postId":57713,"postCreationTime":1264470386,"courseCategoryId":17,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/10 Archived","postParentId":57668,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d306d16"},"forumId":1173,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":19930,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W10","postTitle":"Re: Research Directions in Requirements Engineering","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/10 Archives","topicName":"Research Directions in Requirements Engineering"},{"postUserId":5739,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Jeanne            Thanks for your kind comments. I will answer your questions as you number them. 1. The authors determined the nine hotspots from new Requirements Engineering research challenges that arise from emerging trends in software systems and predictions about future software needs. These nine were chosen since current trends and expressed needs including scale of software systems, tighter integration between software and its environment, greater autonomy of software to adapt to its environment, and increasing globalization of software development. 2. I understand your observation about the hotspots not being new except for Globalization, however what I believe that make them \"new\" is the fact that trends are reflecting changes in stakeholders\u2019 needs, and as such they directly affect Rquirements Engineering processes and practices. In some cases, current technologies can accommodate the new trends in requirements. In other cases, the trends pose new research challenges in requirements engineering, or raise the priorities of longstanding research problems. 3. I believe that on this question you and the authors differ greatly. The authors believe and I agree with them that industry can provide industrial-strength project data to researchers. It is especially critical that industry provide realistic data for ultra-large scale or cyber-physical systems to ensure that researchers tackle problems that are representative of those faced by practitioners. Researchers can use this data to guide the development and validation of their new techniques, thereby yielding more relevant and useful research results that explicitly address industrial needs. 4. I dont believe that the authors are inplying that Requirements Engineering researchers are not doing their \"job\" properly, I believe what the authors are doing is to analyze the trends in requiements engineering and based on their analysis they are making recommendation for short and long term improvements in the area. For example in this time of modern databases,Requirements Eengineering researchers and practitioners, together, can establish repositories of Requirements Engineering artifacts. Such repositories can serve as a resource for practitioners and educators to share best practices and exemplar artifacts. Repositories can also store requirements patterns for potential reuse, case studies that evaluate individual or composite RE techniques, benchmark data for evaluating competing technologies, and tools that support specific RE techniques.

To answer your questions, Yes I do think that requirements gathering process is influenced by the environment where it is to be gathered. For example, introducing a new system in an organization can often times be difficult because of opposition of people who resist change or some who believe or know that the new system will result in them loosing their job. So if there is opposition to the new system, gathering requirements from these same people who may be key stakeholders can result in poor or inadequate requirements. Organizational culture does affect the type and quality that is sought by the requirements gatherer. If an organization has an open culture and by open culture I mean people in that organization are readily available, friendly and easy to talk with, then the requirements gatherer can readily get information from such organization. However if the organization is one such that people are always oppose to change and must be pushed by management in order to give information, then the requirements gatherer will find that his task may not be easy especially since projects require that phase such as requirements gathering must be done in a specific time period in order for the project to be completed on time and within budget.

I appreciate your kind words. To answer your question, I do understand your concern with respect to medical systems, I certainly would not want to be wrongly diagnosed either and in the same vein I would not want the system to break or malfunction in the process of carrying out a diagnostic on me. However, what the Authors were saying of which I can appreciate is that these systems can be very complex. So in the process of striving for absolute safety and correctness, this can lead to brittle systems. Brittle systems tend to fail at the first encounter of adverse conditions. So to avoid this problem, requirement elicitation should focus on requirements for acceptable behavior and on what it means for the system to be \"healthy\". In other words the need to accept \"sufficent correctness\". Here sufficent correctness is the degree to which a system must be dependable in order to server the purpose its user intends, and to do so well enough to satisfy the current needs and expectations of those users. While we know that safety and correctness is very important, we need to focus on the system doing what is expected. The authors believe that one approach to relaxing the perception  of correctness criteria is to specify (fault) tolerance requirements, which extend the ranges of acceptable behavior.

However, I do not believe you would like my voice if I start singing, I remember the last time I tried, even the birds flew away . To answer your question, No, the authors did not single out any particular SDLC methodology. They look at requirements engineering in a broad context. No matter what the methodology used, successful requirements gathering  has one major aim which is  understanding the needs of users, customers and other stakeholders; understanding the contexts in which the to-be-developed software will be used; modeling, analyzing, negotiating, and documenting the stakeholders requirements; validating that the documented requirements match the negotiated requirements; and managing requirements evaluation. The paper basically focused on research directions and identifies Requirements engineering challenges posed by emerging and future software needs no matter what methodology is used to effect a solution. Therefore what the paper is saying is that the require process is to accomplish this makor aim no matter the methodology you will use to solve the problem.

Answer: The authors did use a small example at the penultimate section of the paper. Emphasis on the word 'small'. Thus, my criticism about the paper being very technical, and inaccessible to anyone who is not scientifically minded (I am NOT talking about myself here, by the way [])... The example that they used pertained to an inspection technique known as 'Reading'. This inspection technique is used to analyze textual documentation related to requirements, design, code, and test plans. The objective of this technique is to encourage local improvements to software development processes, which in turn should filter to a global level. The example was brief, and mentioned that NASA applied it in its processes. I must admit that it did not provide much insight to how it can be applied to other organizations, in other industries, in spite of the authors mentioning the 'transfer of the results in other industries', and 'increases in the predictability of project performance'.

I already told Gregg , that I 'moved heaven, hell, earth, and other parts of the unknown universe to try and get this right' [] To answer your questions: 1. A single protocol for research must be developed to govern research activities across the three trends (Embedded systems, cross disciplanary, ubiquituous systems). Is this acheivable? is it even wise? This issue must be enforced and mandated by the research benefactor\/ research sponsor, who will be supporting\/ funding the potential researcher. This is one way that it can be achieved. Is this wise? Well, it is all dependent on the type of research phenomenon to be studied. If it is to study the application or effect of a common concept in another industrial context, which has already been done elsewhere, then the research sponsor should tell the prospective researcher to derive his\/ her conclusions via inference from similar research studies that have been performed in another industrial context. And save those potential research dollars. 2. A on-size-fits-all approach often winds up doing more harm than good. Is there an alternative? I have to agree with you that a one-size-fits-all approach is not always a good idea. But, as I mentioned before, if researchers are going to be performing research on how a common computer science\/ software engineering concept, or theory, fares in a particular industry, then surely it would be better to establish the outcome through inference, as opposed to spending valuable dollars on research trying to ascertain something that could have been deduced from common sense. So, I should have been a lot more articulate about that point, and emphasized the 'inference' bit in my presentation. The alternative, in my opinion, would be for researchers to take initiative when they embark on a research activity. They have been allocated x amount of dollars to study y phenomenon, be it in computer science or software engineering. Once they have completed their research studies, the onus is upon the researchers to include in their conclusions how their research findings can be applied to other industrial contexts; and provide and illustrate the proposed applications thoroughly.

My answers to your thought-provoking questions are as follows: 1. Could you contrast this paper to the papers identified in Unit 1 Section 1, Objective 1? Answer: A paper that contrasts what I have discussed is the following Chapter 1: Sections \"What is Software Engineering?\" to \"Limitations Related to the Book Format\" of SWEBOK [Abran et al. 2004]. This resource does not go further in proposing that another discipline must be formed that is based on formalism, and relies heavily on empiricism, mathematics, and computer science. In this resource, the authors only make a point of making software engineering, as we know it, a more formalized discipline, without the need for formulating a new discipline, i.e. empirical software engineering. And in as much as you did not ask me to give a similarity, here you go: Looking at Unit 1, Section 1, Objective 1 again, one paper has a relationship with the paper that I just presented: Engle, C.B., Jr. (1989), \"Software Engineering is Not Computer Science,\" In Lecture Notes in Computer Science: Vol. 376. Software Engineering Education, G. Goos and J. Hartmanis (Series Eds.), and N. E. Gibbs (Vol. Ed.), Springer, Berlin, Germany, pp. 257-262. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/BFb0042363 In as much as this paper is over two decades old, there is still a lot of relevance to the content covered by the authors, in terms of the disparity between computer science and software engineering. As long as there is a lack of interaction between the two disciplines, this situation will persist. 2. Do you consider yourself a software engineer or a computer scientist? Why? Answer: In as much as my undergrad was focused on fundamental sciences (computer science, information systems, and economics), I regard myself a software engineer because I demand method and formality in the way I develop software for the employers that I worked for, and the software that I write for myself. 3. Does the formula you identified (G == f(P, C), appear in other papers? Answer: The expression forms part of the discussion on the challenges faced by organizations to strike a balance between the process in question, and the environment that the process resides in, in order to achieve a given goal. The authors make reference to the following resource: Stalk, G., Evans, P., Shulman, L.: Competing on Capabilities: the New Rules of Corporate Strategy. Harvard Business Review, 57\u201369 (1992) 4. What specifically made the paper difficult to understand?

The answers to your questions are as follows: 1. Why did the authors think that the term software engineering be replaced with emperical engineering ? what would be the significance for the name change? Answer: It is not for the sake of the name change that the authors are pushing the issue, but rather for the sake of how things are being done in software engineering. More specifically, the authors want educational institutions to place more focus in the way computer science concepts and constructs are applied in software engineering, and when research is done in one industrial context, in either of the two disciplines, the findings must be applicable across various industries. Also, when the authors use the term empirical software engineering, it is with the intent that practitioners place more focus on the effect and applicability of their findings and conclusions, and be able to measure the effects, and be able to reproduce the results in question. 2. The formula G == f(P, C), did the paper illustrate how it was used in an organizational setting or was this a formula proposed for theoretical purposes only? Answer: This formula was referenced in the following publication: Stalk, G., Evans, P., Shulman, L.: Competing on Capabilities: the New Rules of Corporate Strategy. Harvard Business Review, 57\u201369 (1992) and forms part of the discussion on the challenges faced by organizations to strike a balance between the process in question, and the environment that the process resides in, in order to achieve a given goal. The authors make reference to this publication at the end of their paper. 3. From your presentation, can one conclude that Software engineering is a derivative of Computer Science? if not why? Answer: Computer Science is just one of the many fundamental sciences that Software Engineering derives from. It also derives from Psychology and Economics, and also Physics (but this is not shown in the diagram) and Mathematics (I disagree with the authors' classification of Mathematics as an Auxiliary Science!). However, that said, I would not go on to say that Software Engineering is a derivative, per se, of computer science; but rather Software Engineering applies concepts and constructs from the fundamental sciences.

To answer your question: Do you think that the SE field is at a state where fundamental 'laws' of SE can be formulated? Answer: The term software engineering has been around for over 40 years. The term was first used in 1968. Herewith some resources: 1. http:\/\/homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk\/brian.randell\/NATO\/nato1968.PDF 2. http:\/\/homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk\/brian.randell\/NATO\/NATOReports\/index.html In my opinion 40 years is more than enough time to formulate software engineering laws, and thus make the field more formalized. It is also more than enough time to ensure that interaction occurs between the fundamental sciences. So, in a nutshell, I would say yes the SE field should be in a state where laws should be formulated. But current circumstances indicate otherwise, and this to me is a huge problem...

But I also have to point out that the phrase is worn thin. In my career life it has been used by the wrong people, for the wrong reasons.

The technology stack for the project was selected, decided upon, by the executives, based on a sales pitch from a particular product vendor that dazzled them with a particular product, without any consultation from the development team (BAD IDEA...) 2. No communication between team members, and with the organization departments involved. 3. Skulduggery within the development department (I was one of the many that was on the receiving end of it...) 4. Moving targets; nothing was accomplished that was of acceptable quality. 5. Ambiguous requirements.

In that article they said that the building of the pyramids predated the discovery of the arch, as in pre-architecture.

Over the 30 years that I've been working in Information Systems the art of software development has changed a great deal, but in my opinion,  it is still art and those changes are more akin to developing new ways of creating paint ( oil vs tempura ) than new ways of developing systems.

I enjoyed your presentation. I could not agreed more with your observation.. I think competition and luck of leadership in the industry to the issues that concern software engineering causes problems to the elevation of software engineering in the industry. Another issue is that products are sold most of the time based on marketing more than how they are engineered. I think studies can be done to compare if most sold products on the market today are a result of better engineering or just a mere fact that those products landed first on the market and took the market hostage with a lot of marketing strategy.

Windows 7 comes with snipping Tool, and other popular one is SnagIt. 2. Instead of taking the whole screen in the screenshot, it could be cropped to the required contents to improve the visibility.

General    It is a great one as Ed has no reference of other videos from our group.  We will have the benefit of learning from others comment to improve our deliverable.  Therefore, I believe the resolution could be improved but not important - I read the original paper.  Ed uses the least time to deliver (compare with us) and he is a brave and great guy. 1. Keywords - I suggest to summarize the keyword explanation on one slide to provide background knowledge. This will allow more time to talk about the paper. - Same as the other peer, Wiki is not a solid site for research although the content may be right. 2. Goal and Problem Statement - The presentation speak about the problem of limitation, I suggest to include the \"...requirement is the most difficult phase in the software design and Lutz showed that 60% of errors in the critical systems were resulted of requirement errors\"   This will related the requirement error could be reduced if we could remove some limitations or constraints by using the suggested sysML. 3. Purpose of Study - I felt the Research Question \"How to improve user requirement modeling and analysis for software-intensive system with SysML\" is more direct.  And it will help the audience easier to accept the conclusion. 4. One slide to summarize the section 3 - requirements modeling approaches, to briefly cover NL, SNL, XP, UC, and SysML.  It will give the rationale why the author choose SysML because of its strength. 5. Relation to COMP610 - The other way is copying the original statement on pg 329 \"Requirement engineerig is a very influential ..... Software Quality Knowledge.\" together with you current slide.  It will show the perspective of the author and yours. 6. The future research is the added value from Ed, which is a great one. =================================================================================================== About the research paper: 1. In the table (1), it list requirements and classification of \"M\"ust and \"S\"hould.  From the table and explanation, it explains how SysMLl covers Independent towards methodology, Relationship between requirement; and Relationship requirement\/design.  However, it also show the weakness of SysML not able to address the Identify types of requirement, Requirement Risk, etc.    It has no weight factors of requirement, therefore, it could be equally weighted.  Using equal weighted approach, it shows RD is the best.    If author suggested to have combined approach, it may mean RD + XP will cover most.    SysML has an advantage that it is an extensible language; and could be improved to address the weakness with time. 2. The research paper provide conclusion but not out-looking \/ trends. =================================================================================================== My 2 cents and will wait for my turn. Have a nice day.

I think my day went into answering you (and the others), but thank you for taking the time and effort to write so much. I will take your advice with your point 1. For point 2, are you referring to how SysML accounts for non-functional requirements? These include constraints and they are wanted. Or are you referring to errors in constraints? If yes, then I believe the approach is iterative and continuously attempts to find and correct errors as part of the process. Please refer to the list of characteristics and how they relate to this approach. However, this may not be as clear in the paper as it should. Thank you for your advice in your points 4 and 5. Your comments about the paper are right on. The weighting is too vague. It is not quantitative. The paper does not explain how it came about these conclusions in either table 1 or table 2.

For example; I would like to access inventory information presented in a color scheme that is \"friendly\"  where I could easily cross reference  with a shipping manifest (sorry if that example leaves something to be desired).

I believe that while approaches that rely too much on natural language lack consistency, completeness and are ambiguous, well-defined approaches like SysML may go the opposite way and are too rigid.

You will be a hard act to follow!  I have a few questions about the content of the presentation: 1. You say that the paper identified problems with existing requirements techniques, but you don't say what those problems were. What problems does SysML address? 2. You say that the paper details all the advantages of SysML, but these are not identified in the presentation. How is SysML better? 3. SysML seems best suited for projects with a very formal and elaborate requirements analysis stage. Is SysML relevant for agile software projects (like those covered in Unit 6)? How would it fit? How do SysML proponents view the growing popularity of agile approaches to requirements documentation, analysis, and management? 4. The paper compares SysML to other requirements documentation techniques by evaluating them against a set of criteria. This is a very abstract approach. It would be interesting to see the authors evaluate the use of SysML in a real world context. This could take the form of a case study of a project using SysML, or a comparison of the project outcomes on SysML projects vs. non-SysML projects. Did you see any evidence that the more formal requirements modelling actually improved real project outcomes? Thanks, and congrats on being the first one finished!

Please refer to sections 1.2 Research question and 3 Requirements modeling approaches for the answer. The example is a subset of user requirements for a road traffic management system which was originally written using natural language as is most user requirements.

You say that the paper details all the advantages of SysML, but these are not identified in the presentation. How is SysML better? Basically, the answer is the same as for number 1 above. SysML is a modeling language born out of UML and applies Use-cases. However, for large software systems, it offers more information through a set of Requirements diagrams which help describe properties and relationships among properties better and tables which help manage change due to increased traceability. 3. SysML seems best suited for projects with a very formal and elaborate requirements analysis stage. Is SysML relevant for agile software projects (like those covered in Unit 6)? How would it fit? How do SysML proponents view the growing popularity of agile approaches to requirements documentation, analysis, and management? Excellent question but I do not know the answer at this point. I would have to read more about this topic. However, here is a quote you may find interesting, \"OMG SysML is a visual modelling language that extends UML 2 in order to support the specification, analysis, design, verification and validation of complex systems that include components for hardware, software, data, personnel, procedures and facilities. OMG SysML is intended to be used with different methodologies including structured analysis, object orientation and others. OMG SysML reuses a subset of UML 2 concepts and diagrams and augments them with some new diagrams and constructs appropriate for systems modelling.\" The paper is The SysML Modelling Language Fifth European Systems Engineering Conference 18-20 September 2006 by Matthew Hause. 4. The paper compares SysML to other requirements documentation techniques by evaluating them against a set of criteria. This is a very abstract approach. It would be interesting to see the authors evaluate the use of SysML in a real world context. This could take the form of a case study of a project using SysML, or a comparison of the project outcomes on SysML projects vs. non-SysML projects. Did you see any evidence that the more formal requirements modelling actually improved real project outcomes? No, not from this paper or any of the papers I looked at. I agree with fully on this point. Thank you again for these questions.

In a couple of places, you mentioned code clones, and using ldiff to find them. That sounded really interesting. Can you tell us more about what you mean by clones, and\/or how ldiff detects them? 3. You said you didn't want to go into the limitations of the standard diff tool. But this seems like the author's main motive for developing ldiff. Did the paper include more discussion about this? 4. At about the 7:30 mark, you say ldiff \"suggests\" changes in the code. Do you mean \"shows\"? 5. You mention that this sort of tool is relevant to software maintenance\/evolution. It seems like examining change sets is also pretty relevant to development work too. Especially when an iterative development process is being used. 6. It's interesting that the authors worked with CVS repositories, and thus felt the need to come up with a method to identify changesets. Most version control systems these days provide built-in change set tracking (SVN, git, mercurial, etc). Why do you think they chose to work with the older tool? 7. I took at look at figure 1 in the paper (it was hard to read on the slide). I compared the changes shown at the top of the figure (detected by the standard diff tool) with the changes at the bottom (after ldiff has been applied).

Here are my best replies.. 1. The audio included quite a bit of background noise. I had trouble making out some words at one or two points. Reply: I apologize for the audio problems, in my original video it is clear and audible. I am also not satisfied with the voice clarity when it was uploaded. This is my first time to create such video and I am sorry for the shortcomings. 2. In a couple of places, you mentioned code clones, and using ldiff to find them. That sounded really interesting. Can you tell us more about what you mean by clones, and\/or how ldiff detects them? Reply: code clones are code portion in the source files that is identical or similar to another that reduces software maintanibility. (http:\/\/staff.unak.is\/andy\/MScTestingMaintenance\/Lectures\/CCFinder2002.pdf) the journal stated that source code cloes were often considered bad software development practice because they can potentially cause maintainability problems owing to the need to propagate changes over them.  According to the authors, Ldiff's code-tracking approach analyze change propagation across clones.  Ldiff tools ability to track clone evolution makes it suitable for use in implementing systems that can automatically track clone changes propagations and warn developers of improperly propagated changes. 3. You said you didn't want to go into the limitations of the standard diff tool. But this seems like the author's main motive for developing ldiff. Did the paper include more discussion about this? Reply: the author just focus on the limitations of UNIX diff tools and how ldiff overcome it.  the paper also briefly discussed about UML diff and Change Distiller in which I explained in my reply to Alex (my first reply thread) 4. At about the 7:30 mark, you say ldiff \"suggests\" changes in the code. Do you mean \"shows\"? Reply: I said \"suggest\" code changes since the authors stated that \" No automatic differencing tool would be able to unambigously distinguishe changes from the programmer's addition and removal, but a tool that can suggest likely changes would be desirable\" the author is referring to Ldiff. 5. You mention that this sort of tool is relevant to software maintenance\/evolution. It seems like examining change sets is also pretty relevant to development work too. Especially when an iterative development process is being used. Reply: actually as I see it, you are right it is good in examining change sets in the development of the software.  The paper states that ldiff enhances the ability of the differencing tool to distinguish line additions or removal from line changes that makes a more precise versioning system which monitors software evolution. 6. It's interesting that the authors worked with CVS repositories, and thus felt the need to come up with a method to identify changesets. Most version control systems these days provide built-in change set tracking (SVN, git, mercurial, etc). Why do you think they chose to work with the older tool? Reply:  the authors did not mentioned why the use CVS but I will try to answer you with my own understanding: First let us define CVS -  The Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is used by software developers to keep track of the development process. Many software projects, particularly in the field of open-source development, require developers in different parts of the world to collaborate to create and maintain software. Also known as the Concurrent Versioning System, CVS is a method used to ensure that each developer can keep track of changes that are made within the software. (http:\/\/www.wisegeek.com\/what-is-the-concurrent-versions-system.htm) And I think the advantage of using CVS is: using CVS allows to keep better records without too much additional effort showing history of changes in order and see more easily what has worked for a long time and where to begin looking through the code. (http:\/\/www.eecs.harvard.edu\/~jonathan\/CVS_Example.pdf) 7. I took at look at figure 1 in the paper (it was hard to read on the slide). I compared the changes shown at the top of the figure (detected by the standard diff tool) with the changes at the bottom (after ldiff has been applied). It seemed to me that the ldiff version would actually be harder to understand than the normal diff output. Do you think this might be a reason why development of the tool has stalled? Reply: It was really unfortunate that Figure 1 is not clear.  Anyway, as I have seen in the results of diff and ldiff is that ldiff did detected the last added use-case event compared to diff.  My idea on why the tool was stalled is because of the development of too many more precise file comparison\/code tracking tools such us Microsoft WinDiff, Diffmerge by SourceGear, ExamDiff pro (freeware) and many more tools that are already integrated with different IDE or SDK and are GUI base. 8. Following on 7. above -- this seems like a great area for further research: how does ldiff impact on the code maintainers' ability to comprehend the change sets? Does it improve it, hurt it, or not have much effect? Reply:I think the ldiff's tool ability to track clones could help avoid bugs appearing twice or more in the system thus reducing risk this at the end will improve the code maintainers ability to understand change sets.","courseId":245,"phaseId":3,"postId":73220,"postCreationTime":1296514009,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":72797,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d301d7b"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23729,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: Ronnie Llave Presentation report for TMA1","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"Ronnie Llave Presentation report for TMA1"},{"postUserId":6210,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Thanks for the reply.

Few questions\/comments:   You mentioned that Ldiff can be used to mark specific areas of code. Does this mean that certain critical areas can be monitored for change? I am thinking if a part of the source code is very critical, changes to them can be identified and verified before rollout. Towards the end you mentioned this tool requires Unix diff tool. Does this mean this is currently available only in Unix environment? As a weak point you mentioned that the author has not discussed how this tool will integrate with IDE. I know for sure most to the utilities in Microsoft Visual Studio IDE are command line based but can be called transparently from within the IDE. I think Eclipse works the same way too.

I liked the way you linked the material to the author's previous work. The presentation really resonated with me, because I have done a lot of work on agile development projects, in small organizations. The issue of weak clients is huge, and the industry literature really does gloss over it.  Some agile variants (especially scrum) encourage the client (product owner) to assign a money estimate of business value to each story. Once the team estimates the effort required to complete the story, the benefit ratio can be used to help guide prioritization. Unfortunately, when you ask a client to tell you the business value of  \"the customer should get an email confirmation of their order,\" you usually get a blank stare, followed by an awkward giggle. You never get a meaningful answer. Does the paper talk about how these estimates are produced, or refer to any research that does? The idea that prioritization is not important in smaller organizations is interesting. I've worked on several greenfield projects and legacy system replacement projects, all in small organizations. On the replacement projects, prioritization always breaks down, because \"everything is needed.\" But on the greenfield projects, the clients are able to prioritize effectively. In some cases, these have been the same individuals. Is it possible that the authors ran into some sample bias here? The idea that requirements can be refined through iteration, and this reduces the risk of building unfit software is central to agile. However, on long-running agile projects, there is enough time for people to forget the rationale behind early requirements choices, and flip flop. Since previous iterations are probably already released to production, there is also the opportunity for maintenance requests to take priority over the originally envisioned project scope. The result is a never-ending project. Did the projects surveyed include any long-running ones? Did they see any evidence of this kind of problem? The examination of how requirements analysis was carried out on these projects sounds like a great idea for a follow up paper.","courseId":245,"phaseId":4,"postId":73155,"postCreationTime":1296409739,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73092,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d307ab7"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23825,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 Week 3","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 Week 3"},{"postUserId":5743,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Jonathan As far as estimates are concerned the paper itself does not really address that point although it is discussed a little in the related research. Certainly the authors mention the size of a user story or feature driven request in the context of the developer supplying decision making information to the client. While there is no explicit suggestion of how that process occurs the authors do reference a book by Cohn. http:\/\/www.niwotridge.com\/BookReviews\/AgileEstimatingandPlanning.pdf Based on my own experience estimation is a discrete task that a single developer generates based on previous experience. At best a team might look at a story and generate a consensus estimate.  With regards to your question on sample bias I think that is very possible. One of the points I did try to drive home was the risk of the limited sample size. That being said I do believe the Greenfield example fits within the context of the paper. The challenges of recreating or modifying existing software are generally more complex than creating a brand new program. There are a significant number of dependencies in managing a legacy change over and that speaks directly the expertise of the client representative. Unless the client representative is highly experienced they would be very challenged by a complicated project. That being said the research does not refer to what the nature of the sample projects were. This also relates to your final question about long running projects. The paper does indicate that prioritization was used in larger undertakings but it did not indicate if there were any problems with managing changes to previous iterations. One shortfall of the investigation was that it seemed to focus on the each iteration as a discrete unit. With value generation being localized to each prioritization set. The only reference that I saw to previous functionality was in the context of \u201Cnegative value\u201D. In one project the developers did go back and implement a piece of \u201Cmissed\u201D functionality that was having a business impact of the client organization. That appeared to be a discrete requirement and not necessarily a \u201Cchange request\u201D on an existing function.

About your research, 1. About the approach could be \"subjective\", it is possible but the authors select organization across country and size could reduce it.  Even we have a broader survey, it still have a factor of \"subjective\" but lower because of larger sample.  I feel comfortable on the approach. 2. I found the author select only one client could be a problem.  Requirement prioritization is from business value; and the interview found the client is kind of narrow scope - identify his\/her report as the most important one.  I suggest to increase the percentage of client in the interview - to understand their role and their mesaure of satisfaction. 3. Your comment of missing measures (i.e. customer satisfaction) of the project.  My question relation to yours is \"What should be the measure to determine the project outcome?\".  Should it be \"Satisfactory of project sponser?\", \"Project delivers benefit as stated in the business cases?\".  It may be a good research topic. 4. The finding of decision made most by developer, not business.  I observed in our organization too, but it makes concern about the practicality of \"business\" making decsion.  My question is whether \"business is ready to accept this role ?\".  If business not ready (either not accept or not having skill\/knowledge), should IT (developer) make the decsion on their behalf and adjust the Agile process ? 5.

When looking a project measures there are a few items I would focus on which are both mathematical and subjective in nature. From a mathematical perspective I think it is important to note which requirements were completed and what there priority was to the client. That would indicated to me what the success level of the process was. I think there also needs to be some evaluation of how closely the programming solution met the client requirement. This may also apply to rework and the degree to which requirements needed to be refined over the course of a project. As for overall satisfaction that is more subjective but also very important. I think I should qualify that I am referring to the satisfaction at the organization level (not just the client rep). This speaks to meeting client needs as well as the success of the requirement prioritization process as a whole. The roles part brings up an interesting point for me. Agile is by its definition supposed to be flexible and dynamic in nature. As a result I find it ironic that there would be a sticking point on literature Vs real world. I would think the approach should be flexible based on the client and developer skill sets. Software development is a complex human interaction regardless of the project size. Adding the technical layer on top increases that exponentially. From that perspective I think the goal is to find a comfort zone for both client and developer. If that can be achieved (through good communication) I think the level of client involvement should be flexible.","courseId":245,"phaseId":4,"postId":73484,"postCreationTime":1296930295,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73464,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d307b18"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23825,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 Week 3","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 Week 3"},{"postUserId":6182,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Alex: Here is my observations with my comments & questions: Cosmetic: Presentation was nicely laid out with good flow of discussion topic.

Instead of having to wait for the conclusion of a major project it allows value to realized within the first iterations. I would tend to agree with you that the paper is somewhat thin on the \"how\". To be fair however I don't think that was the authors objective. I suspect based on their ideas for future work that that will be the focus of follow up research (process, metrics, methodology are all mentioned). Scrum can definitely play an important role within the development cycle by allowing the internal team to communicate more effectively. Agile generally focuses on the client-developer interactions but the internal team dynamics are no less important. By focusing development activities and making practioners aware of each others activities there is nodoubt that an increase in quality is achieved. It also provides an important forum for conflict resolution and problem solving both of which provide considerable value. Negative value impacts are quite simply the business \"loss\" that occurs when a feature is not included in development. For example in the case of a manufacting organization if a software product cannot provide effective quality tracking numbers (making it necessary to do that manually) it would result in a negative business impact. Let me know if that example helps. As for Agile being a \"cowboy\" methodology I think it is quite the opposite. Because of the iterative cycle and the constant stakeholder feedback (and reprioritization of requirements) I think there is far more accountability that in traditional methods (like waterfall). There is much less opprotunity for a single programmer to start coding in an unanticipated direction. The test harnesses and continuous integration elements also prevent the inclusion of development that is completely unmanaged. I don't know that additonal research would help with that process. Not surpisingly the easier way to appreciate the value for Agile is to be involved a project that uses it. I think it is noteworthy that all of the practitioners interviewed had moved to an Agile approach from a more traditional methodoloy thus indicating that they saw it as an improved development process.","courseId":245,"phaseId":4,"postId":73618,"postCreationTime":1297043012,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73609,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d307b5b"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23825,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 Week 3","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 Week 3"},{"postUserId":3212,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Alex, Thank you for a very fine presentation.

In fact Agile is for the most part tool agnostic. Certainly modelling could be done as part of the analysis but generally that would be at a very high level or at a very low level as it pertains to a specific user story (or orther requirement gathering technique). From a documentation standpoint Agile advocates \"just enough\". It identifies the pitfalls of over documentation and suggests that overlap should be avoided at all costs. It is also interesting to note that Agile views documentation as a communication tool and as such values face to face or verbal interactions much higher. The following is an interesting link referencing a book by Scott Ambler on the subject: http:\/\/www.agilemodeling.com\/essays\/agileDocumentationBestPractices.htm As for wasted effort Agile utilizes a short iteration cycle and feedback which is designed to guide prioritization so as to avoid falling out of sync with the client expectations.  I would include meeting technical specification in that area as well. This is probably one of the biggest discussion points between traditional anlysts and Agile advocates that I have seen. How much lead analysis is necsesary and does it time up front actually save more time development than would have been spent without it? Agile advocates would view using ongoing development as more efficient and effective - especially when dealing with changing or fuzzy requirements. Certainly SysML, BPM or any other modelling tools could be used but within Agile that would be as a mechanism to imporve communication rather than as a preliminary development process.","courseId":245,"phaseId":3,"postId":73735,"postCreationTime":1297194482,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73731,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d307b31"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23825,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 Week 3","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 Week 3"},{"postUserId":5748,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Everyone, I finallly got my presentation uploaded.

I found it closely related to my topic.  A project group, composed of a few of the authors along with other interested paticipants has already developed an Eclipse-based implementation of a rule-enhanced BPMN (rBPMN) editor called rbpmneditor. Their web page has the editor plug-in downloads, tutorials, documents and the news. Here is the web site address: http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/rbpmneditor\/ About conversion from BPMN to BPEL generally you are correct but different approaches such as restricting the BPMN diagrams to well-formed processes are being employed and more research and implementations will narrow the gap. I look forward to see more restrictions being enforced through BPMN editors for processes that are intended for roundtrip conversions to BPLE. This will pave the way for simpler conversions and gradually these restrictions will evolve into systematic best practices for BPEL convertible processes.  AORML introduced a UML profile for an Agent-Oriented Modeling approach called Agent-Object-Relationship. This was basically an extension of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) whereas rBPMN is an extension of BPMN. As you can see the authors chose a totally different approach to solve the problem.

Business rules often reveal important details of business processes. Changes to business rules may change the flow of tasks, influence decisions on a particular task, or cause automatic completion of tasks. As a workflow designer, having a complete and clear layout of business rules in the process design provides the means to map out every possible step and connection and create a much more complete and well-rounded workflow. Later changes to the rules can be implemented on the rule object and the resulting flow connections can be readjusted on the same diagram. This will usually cause minimal changes to the process itself such as adding or deleting steps. This is also much easier to implement, test and deploy. Whereas if the rules are developed in a different environment and later integrated into the business processes, changes to the rule often cause workaround and unexpected process change. This is also much more time consuming in terms of development, test and deployment.   Exceptions in business processes can be handled with rule definitions in rBPMN. Considering exceptions as an important part of business rules, exceptions can be categorized into two different types: \u201CExpected Exceptions\u201D and \u201CUnexpected Exceptions\u201D. Expected exceptions are those situations that are known to the workflow designer in advance. Workflows compensate for exception handlers that rely on the semantics of the process to handle the exception. When an exception is unexpected, the designer typically resorts to halting the process and invoking a human intervention. - Workflows >> Normal behaviour of a process - Expected Exceptions >> Occasional behaviour of a process - Unexpected Exceptions >>  Process halt, human intervention. Expected exceptions may require special treatment, which may lead to the execution of a completely different process. Including rule definitions inside the workflow diagrams is a major step towards further reconciliation of the domain model with business processes.  The following paper gives a pretty good review of exceptions in workflows: Specification and implementation of exceptions in workflow management systems http:\/\/0-portal.acm.org.aupac.lib.athabascau.ca\/citation.fm?id=328939.328996 Behzad","courseId":245,"phaseId":4,"postId":74002,"postCreationTime":1297680070,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73701,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d307b9c"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23946,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 - Week 4","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 - Week 4"},{"postUserId":6182,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Behzad: Nice presentation. here is my feedback & few questions: Cosmetic: Presentation was laid out very well.

The second question is why the article is a little outdated.  At that time dual core processing units were still in the lab or on a designers desk.  Therefore, the article was writen at a time when only single processers were available.  Therefore,  the authors wanted a full object lock implemented into the OOP environment to make sure when a thread executed it could lock the object and thus prevent other threads from accessing the object.  This would prevent deadlocks and variables being interchanged across many threads causing confusion and delay.  Today who cares?  Multiprocesser computers can execute threads concurrently each accessing the same object and still keep things straight.  The only problem with multiprocessors is assigning which processor is in charge.  The multiprocessor computers do not have that problem but rather have the problem of some processer chips being idle because work load may not be assigned evenly across the chips. Aspect oriented programming is a completly new programming methodolgy.  I gave its definition in the paper.  It is currently being worked on as a programming platform to replace OOP programming platforms.","courseId":245,"phaseId":4,"postId":73041,"postCreationTime":1296286789,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73028,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d307abe"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23766,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 Assignment for Comp 610","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 Assignment for Comp 610"},{"postUserId":6182,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi George: Congratulations on the presentation, very interesting topic.

Certain widely used java frameworks seem to facilitate the \"ignore-for-now\" strategy. Spring and Hibernate both have good internal exception handling, using a large number of pretty fine-grained exception classes. However, in both cases, all of the exceptions are unchecked (runtime) exceptions, that calling methods are not forced to handle. The documentation for one of them (spring, I think) justifies this by saying that it is rarely possible for application code to recover from \"system\" failures.

But their justification is that their goal was to conduct a qualitative study. This number provided enough interesting observations and consistency. Some organizations had guidelines on how to handle exceptions. All the developers - novices or experts- are expected to follow the guidelines. Yes, initially it is possible that a single person developed the entire guideline but over time the entire team will end up contributing to it. I would see this as organization's guidelines rather than a person's guidelines.   The authors claim that the novices approach was consistent when it comes to exception handling (low priority tasks). They also viewed it a tangential to the main line of code. This I think explains the novices approach; they don't consider exception handling code as required and important as the main code. Please note that this does not mean they have no exception handling code; the code is not handling exceptions appropriately with require level of granularity. Similar to your suggestion (novices to work in application support) the authors have also found that novice attempted to understand exception handling code if it already existed.","courseId":245,"phaseId":2,"postId":73511,"postCreationTime":1296947560,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73463,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d307b36"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23832,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 - Week 3 Presentation","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 - Week 3 Presentation"},{"postUserId":6182,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Ramesh: Here is my feedback and few questions: Cosmetic: Presentation was nicely laid out with good flow of discussion topic.

Questions: As the objective of paper is to improve the quality of error handling, I feel the study groups of professionals have a wide gap of expertise level. The quality of work between novice and expert is very easy to spot. In my opinion Authors should have opted for medium & expert level expertise of professional, to pick up the very fine mistakes in the subject matter, which is hard to be located, where the actual improvements are required for fine tuning the process. What are your thoughts are? Per your slide I see the set of questions asked from both groups are same. In my viewpoint, the questionnaire needs to be categorized in two group each, where the first part carries all basic questions, and second part needs to have with specialized question per the expert level group. Since it was a novice level of group, they will have limited exposure and have limited ability to see the complication of the questions.

Even with the selection criteria used by authors there were substantial differences in approach. The authors proposed the exception handling selection model that the novices can use to learn from experts. Regarding your suggestion to improve the exception handling code using medium and expert groups, I would add other methods such as code reviews, peer discuss forums etc.   The questions start the same but the expert questionnaire has 21 questions while the novice questionnaire has only 11. I used first few to show that the basic questions are covered for experts. The paper lists all the questions as appendix.   A quick search on template based exception handling I found the paper below. This discusses how to identify the exception conditions early in the lifecycle. I also came across the same with sample codes in Java in number of blog posts. I think template based approach is natural using the encapsulation concept of OOP.   Shudo, H.; Ohnishi, A.; , \"A Method for Exception Scenarios Generation Using Templates of Exceptions,\" Software Engineering Conference (APSEC), 2010 17th Asia Pacific , vol., no., pp.13-22, Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 3 2010 doi: 10.1109\/APSEC.2010.12 URL: http:\/\/0-ieeexplore.ieee.org.aupac.lib.athabascau.ca\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5693176&isnumber=5693172","courseId":245,"phaseId":3,"postId":73715,"postCreationTime":1297162563,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73615,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d307b30"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23832,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","disagreement":true,"postTitle":"Re: TMA1 - Week 3 Presentation","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 - Week 3 Presentation"},{"postUserId":3212,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Ramesh, Thank you for your presentation and for a fascinating topic.

The authors themselves have identified some threats to their study and have provided adequate defense. This is a qualitative study rather than quantitative. Even with s small number of participants the results show fundamental differences in approaches. Another misunderstanding is that the authors did not say that novices are ignoring the exception code but rather not consider it part of the main code. 'Ignore-For-Now' does not mean having no exception handling code. I think it means that a novice developer is not designing, developing exception handling  with the required level of detail. In future studies the authors have mentioned that they would like to do a similar study for real time systems.

I my opinion, it is too early at the development life cycle to do this. This requiement forces the developer to determine the algorithm for deriving data; this should be done during the coding stage. 3) I agree with your comment concerning the efficiency of such process.

Thanks!  There was a lot of text on some of the slides, and this made them blurry and hard to read. Some questions about the content: 1. Like Ramesh, it seemed pretty obvious to me that they were talking about something like test driven development. I wonder, if they are going to teach TDD, why not use that name instead of making up a new one? Industry is aware of TDD, and would recognize its value, but hasn't heard of TBC. 2. At 3:52, you say \"if tests fail... go back and write more similar tests\" (and the paper repeats this several times). To me, this seems like the opposite of normal TDD practice. If you already have a test that demonstrates the error, what's the point of adding redundant ones? 3. After all the tests pass, students are supposed to send the program to QA. Were the authors just telling the students \"this is what you'd do next in the real world,\" or did they actually have someone performing QA? That seems unlikely, so I was left a bit confused about which parts of the process the students actually followed. 4. You say that writing quality programs is expensive. Why do people keep trying to do it? 5. TDD is a well known concept, and there is a fair amount of research that looks into its impact on quality and productivity (it took me about 10 seconds to find these   two). How come the authors chose to rely on something as subjective as \"the faculty felt...\" rather than citing some of this related work?","courseId":245,"phaseId":3,"postId":73656,"postCreationTime":1297084705,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73613,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d307b54"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23933,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 - Week 4","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 - Week 4"},{"postUserId":4664,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hey Jonathan, Thanks for the feedback. 1) I agreed with you that why not use TDD instead of making up a new one.

I really don't know how you could have broken that down though as it was all relevant to the presentation. My first question involves the cross cutting aspects themselves (goals \/ standards \/ projects \/ lifecycles). I am not entirely clear on the relationship that they have with the modelling components. Do you see them as physical expressions of the modelling process (outcomes) or as sources of input that are used to generate the models? You also mention the use of metrics. How would measuring the cross cutting items be used to influence the models? Would they be part of a feedback loop that would make the modelling process dynamic? Finally you also mention in the presentation that the models are generally too rigid (on size fits all) and that customization is required. How do you see that customization working? Is it in modifying the models themselves or simply in adapting the process that is used to create them?","courseId":245,"phaseId":3,"postId":73516,"postCreationTime":1296952254,"courseCategoryId":20,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Winter\/11 Archived","postParentId":73460,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d3043f3"},"forumId":1486,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":23910,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 W11","postTitle":"Re: TMA1 - Week 4 - Sherman Lam","courseCategoryName":"Grad Winter\/11 Archives","topicName":"TMA1 - Week 4 - Sherman Lam"},{"postUserId":5066,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hi Alex, 1. Yes, you are correct and it has vast amount of raw information.  Each of the framework\/approch is sufficient as  one or more research papers.  Not only that, it is a uncommon topic and covers some advance EA concepts.  For example, many EA professionals may not even know the cross-cutting aspects mentioned in the material.  I try to add some introduction, but it will make the presentation over 20 minutes.  Finally, I choose to follow the research paper structure.  Let the peer ask questions, and I will do my best to answer it.  2. About the cross-cutting aspects of EA, it is also new to me and that's the reason why I choose this paper.  The meaning of cross-cutting aspect means it touchs different level of EA, i.e. business, application, information and infrastrcuture.  The cross-cutting aspects are the goals of models. You could comment typical application project has the cross-cutting aspect, and the answer is \"Yes, you are correct\".  Application is an example of \"Projects\" aspect.  I would said the \"Cross-Cutting Aspect\" is the properties\/artifacts exists in all EA layers.  It is similar to the \"Security\" has a cross-cutting aspect of applications, which existing in different layer and component of an application (e.g. server, authentication, application, database, access, etc.).  Authors assume audience already have such concept, and not provide enough details and explanation. 3. Metrics in the way that we should be able to define it at all EA layers. 4. May be I didn't speak clear.  I need to guess what you're referring to.  If I guess wrong, correct me and I will explain again.  The conceptual (information) model is not rigid, it is simple.  I did mention full blown EA is not practical, as many information collected may have less value to the business goal.  Therefore, EA of each organization require customization.  This will ensure the EA resource and effort spent on collecting the information and architecture effectively support the business goal.

I had to look up sortal, but I found their usage didn't really correspond to any of the definitions I found. Mixin made me think of the Ruby mixins (or Objective C categories), but their usage doesn't seem related to this.   2. The authors feel UML is insufficient to represent mixins and phases. After reading the paper, and looking at the way they modelled mixins, I wasn't totally convinced. What do you think? 3. It seems to me that the conceptual modelling described in the paper adds a lot of complexity to EA modelling, but not a lot of explanatory power. What is the point of creating a model like this? Does it help people create an enterprise architecture? Or help researchers refine EA methods? Would it lead to automation or model-checking possibilities of some kind?  4. Was the paper a pre-print?

In another article from S. Buckl (http:\/\/wwwmatthes.in.tum.de\/file\/Publications\/2010\/Bu10m.pdf), \"Mixins are dispersive types,i.e.specify sets of related(and co-located) properties, of which conversely none provides an identity to the thereby described type.\" 2. I would refine your question as \"Whether UML is sufficient to the Conceptual Information Model of EA\".  I hope you won't view my answer is on the fence - as a practitioners of business and my job nature on business and information architecture, it is sufficient because we made work around on modeling challenges.  If we study at the level of the authors and try to resolve the current constraints of modeling, it is not sufficient as no standard notation developed and agreed.  When I mean agreed, at least it is an accepted practice between the EA professionals and no need to search what is mean by <<sortal>> and <<mixin>>. 3. In sort, I agree with your comment.  Followings are the details: 3.1 In the reality, EA is not just modeling.  Modeling help IT and business to understand the relationship and communicate.  If individual have knowledge of Zachman and TOGAF still find the complexity, how can we expect business and general IT understand the content.  Avoid lengthy respond and made you feel bore, I won't share my view of EA scope and artifacts - if you have interest to discuss, you are more than welcome. 3.2 I view the study and concept are important to address the challenges of EA and make it become a course in the Master Program. It has no standard and agreed practice of EA, it all relies on expereince of individual.  Even TOGAF simply provide a framework; which is same as \"Meta-Group\" in the past.  EA professionals are working hard to promote the importance of the value, however, it is still difficult to get the buy-in and support from both executive and IT.  I hope further study will further \"complicate\" the model by discovering more; and bring it back to high-level (abstraction) by eliminating the less important components. 4.

Like Ramesh, I had trouble to understand the paper simply because the topic is quite unknown to me. Nevertheless, I will try to ask you some questions. As with SysML, the approach to modeling seems to extend UML in order to have modeling which is adequate for Enterprise Architecture (EA). Am I right? If true, could you elaborate on that, or else if false, could you explain why please? Is cross-cutting a form of multi-level modeling, and why is this a requirement for EA? Is this an iterative process which involves stakeholders after requirements elicitation has taken place, or does modeling take place independently once all the goals are known?

Ed, 1. About the SysML and UML, I agree with your viewpoint it requires extension of UML but we don't have a commonly agreed extension yet. 2. EA require multi-level modeling, but it is not the primary cross-cutting aspect referenced by the authors.  A simple explanation is cross-cutting aspect is an attribute \/ component could find at all level of EA regardless it is same level or different level of modeling.  For example, a project will touch all level of EA (business, application, information and infrastructure).  A network zone design will have macro and micro design, but it limited to the infrastructure level only - but yes, it is an operational level used by other EA level like information, application and business. 3. The paper does not indicated that, but following are my 2 cents: Goal and business plan are input to EA.  Once EA developed to support the goal, one or more artifacts are required to present at different level (e.g. business executives; IT executives; and senior management of IT and business).  The EA explaining how IT enable the business vision - when an IT project submitted to sponsor later and co-relate back to the business goal.  Sponsor is easier to understand what's the value and impact; and will make the decision more effective.  If the business not understand how the IT project related, it relies on the senior business manage explaining to the executives and board.  In short, the EA must receive the approval and\/or endorsement from the business executives.  Also, it should be reviewed and revised at least once per year - make sure stay current and reflect the needs.

I have two questions for ya. I'll ask the second one in a separate reply. I had a chance to read the paper and one section that caught my eye was under the \"Collaboration Awareness\". The author talks about checkout\/checkin systems like revision control systems and others like Subversion. He makes this statement \"Workspaces allow engineers to work more efficiently ... [but] they raise several issues including the ability to know which developers are working on a specific artifact\". He then goes on to talk about a particular awareness tool that takes the output from a revision system and creates a \"visualization of several aspects of the development history of a project ... thereby allowing members of a distributed project to be more aware of ongoing and historical activity\". My Question\/Comment is: I've used tools like Subversion and I've never had a problem with figuring out \"which developers are working on a specific artifact\". The versioning component of the software clearly shows who checked in what changes and I easily have the ability to do a differential on any two revisions to find out exactly what lines have been changed. I don't understand his comment about we lack this ability. Slapping a visualization component to show the history (which was generated from the output of a repository system) doesn't seem that revolutionary to me and in fact I've feel that some designers think that if you make everything visual it's better which is a belief I don't subscribe to.

Jim Whitehead in his paper has confined his Collaborative Awareness Tool discussions to primarily configuration managemet systems. He made reference to two othrer tools Palantir and Augur. Jim argues that the primary collaborative mechanism supported by SCM systems is the workspace. Typically each developer has their own workspace, and uses a checkout, edit, checkin cycle to modify a project artifact. The main concern in this arrangement is that if two or more software engineers has to work on same artifact in their respective workspaces, then they may not be aware of the chages being made by each other. Yes, once the artifact is checked-in, the changes can be tracked and merged.  In Jim's words \"workspaces provide isolation from the work of other developers, and hence while an artifact is checked out, no other engineer can see its current state.\" Palantir is on the tools which provides engineers with workspace awareness - i.e. the information about the current activities of other engineers. This awareness of ativities enables software engineers to perform coordination activities sooner (i.e. during the work, not at the end), and potentially avoid conflicts. Augur is the tool which you referred in your email. Augur provides a visualization of various historical and on-going aspects of the artifacts, extracted from an SCM repository.

Details to this answer are added below. The open-source related discussions came up in the customer\u2019s \u201CBroader Participation in Design\u201D section. The background of broad customer\u2019s participation is that many forms of software have high costs for acquiring and learning the software, particularly for enterprise software applications. This often requires customer organizations to deeply understand product architecture and design. In current practice, however, customers are mainly involved in requirements elicitation and testing stages. By increasing the participation of the direct end users of software in its development, software engineers can reduce the risk that the final software does not meet the needs of customer organizations. Involving customers in design and coding phases may raise concerns for and risks of exposing the proprietary or closed-sourced models to the customers. Jim, however, suggests that broadening participation does not necessarily mean that customers would be given access to all source code, or input on all decisions. The intent of broadly participative model is to allow customers to fix those bugs that mostly directly affect them \u2013 just as it is done in the case of open source software, where participants adds to the refinement and growth of the software. Jim observes that the trend toward providing support for distributed development teams in a wide range of development tools makes a broader engagement possible. And open source SCM tools such as Subversion, as well as web-based requirements tools and problem tracking tools make it possible to coordinate globally distributed teams. The practical example of broadly participative development teams has primarily been seen in open source software projects and commercial projects currently do not leverage existing tools\u2019 support for distributed teams to incorporate greater customer participation.

Thus, graphics or editing intensive applications, such as UML diagram editing and source code editing, were traditionally not deemed suitable for the web. The myth of low interactivity was, however, smashed with launch of Google Map in 2005. Now Web 2.0 applications tend to have desktop-like user interface interactivity within a web browser , as well as facilities for other sites to integrate their data into the application, or integrate the site\u2019s data into another application. The core of web-desktop integragation is that Desktop-based IDEs can enhance project collaboration if they are better integrated with web-based IDEs. Recent Web-based tools usually works with SCM tools. Some applications include: Gliffy - that supports browser-based UML diagram editing, WebDAV - aimed to give the Web open interfaces for writing content, ART-SCENE - supports a requirements elicitation approach in which a potentially distributed team writes use cases using a series of structured templates accessible via a Web-based interface, and Rosetta UML. The methods to assess the impacts are not discussed in the paper. Dragan, can hopefully add some quick references or comments on state of assess methods.

The estimation of the effort required to implenment collaboration toola and techniques is dependent on number of factors incuding choice of tool, famarity level of the team members. The CMM level 2 though have some processes in place, yet adoption of tool may vary across organizations.

However, I do have a few issues with the article. My major problem is the authors assume all stakeholders are equal. Anyone works in the software development business knows the biggest clients always receive most of the attention for new feature reviews. I do not think this is wrong. From a business perspective, it is the right thing to do. This is especially true for small application companies that have limited resources. I think the we need to have a numeric value\/factor that defines the stakeholders. For an important stakeholder, a higher score will be assigned. This will correctly adjust the utility to reflect the true \"value\" of the new features. The second problem I have is the article doesn't address feature that is a must have for some companies but not the other. For example, a Canadian company will treat a 2009 T4 release something that is a must have and assigns a very high score. If most of the clients are US companies, this new feature might receive very low score. Does it mean the software company will not provide a release to meet the regulatory requirement? Finally, like you, I have issue about the way they describe value. They seem to focus only on existing stakeholders. How about future stakeholders, potential sales, etc?","courseId":177,"phaseId":3,"postId":52930,"postCreationTime":1253767768,"courseCategoryId":16,"courseFullName":"Computer Science 610: Software Engineering","courseFormat":"weeks","courseSummary":"Fall\/09 Archived","postParentId":52645,"_id":{"$oid":"50e80a53e8e0bd8d9d30105a"},"forumId":1051,"labeledExample":true,"topicId":18454,"courseShortName":"COMP 610 F09","postTitle":"Re: Optimized Resource Allocation for Software Release Planning","courseCategoryName":"Grad Fall\/09 Archives","topicName":"Optimized Resource Allocation for Software Release Planning"},{"postUserId":1478,"forumName":"TMA 1 Forum","forumType":"general","postBody":"Hello Norman, Thanks, I am glad you liked the presentation. You are correct in that not all stakeholders are equal, and thus in existing unstructured release management processes the bigger customer usually gets what they want. However you are missing the point...this algorithm maximizes satisfaction assuming they are all equal, and thus the release plan is optimal for the company, not necessarily for the customers (each individual stakeholder)...indeed S(5) could be defined as the company itself and so has a \"say\" in the release plan. However if you wish to, you can define a lambda multiplier against each stakeholder so for example S(2) priorities are always twice that of S(1) without actually modifying the algorithm itself. But as I say, you defeat the purpose. To your second point, the method I suggest above with making the company a stakeholder and putting the particular regulatory requirement very high in priority would drive the inclusion of that feature in the next release. Another approach is for product management to simply dictate the feature inclusion ahead of other features and override the release plan, and inform the customers of the decision. This is not unrealistic as customers do have a stake in their supplier's success. To your third point, it is difficult if not impossible to predict the specific needs of future customers, just trends in the particular area the software is a part of. However if you want to do a simulation exercise, you could again apply the method I describe above and let S(5) be the \"strawman\" (hypothetical future customer) where you could input features and priorities as a hypothetical. However this could be an expensive exercise as you need to draw real resources to provide estimates against these future features.

I would say that it is considered indirectly in the valuation exercise (particularly the exercise where stakeholders indicate their preferences for a particular feature). It is assumed that a feature's value decreases the latter on (farther out) release you implement it in. Technical risk can be accounted for in the determination of the estimate to implement the feature. You pad (increase) the estimate of features you think are riskier to implement.

I have to disagree with one of the statements that was made though: VUML enables one to create the same output every time for a set of variables.

Code generation is in its infancy, as far as technology goes.  I expect tools to continue to be refined, doing more and more for us.  Already we have tools that can build entire working applications (web+windows) with a few mouse clicks. As user interfaces mature, bringing forth touch and gesture, voice and facial recognition, we are going to REQUIRE code generation to help us out - as it will simply not be feasible from a time and money perspective to build software otherwise.

Requirements gathering is an iffy process at best.  This is because one persons viewpoint is different than another persons.  The role of a business analyst is to gather these perspectives, then merge them (somehow) into a cohesive model.  This is where VUML tries to step in. Eventually, when modeling meets code generation fully, we will then have automated processes that will generate code for every change, whether that is a user role or another related mechanism. At this point, VUML is still a work in progress; a research level tool that requires maturation.  I do see a future for it, although we may not recognize it as such when it arrives.
